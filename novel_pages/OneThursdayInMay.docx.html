            every afternoon but Sunday, when the owners, Bob and Margy Lippart, against current norms and all fiscal
            studies of the time, closed the store for the day. &nbsp;Therefore, it was no surprise that, on this
            Thursday, even with swirling storm clouds and a darkness rivaling nighttime descending on the town of
            Pascal, just outside of Dallas, Texas, the store was crowded with shoppers.</span></p>

            shift was almost over, but he wouldn&rsquo;t get out of here before the storm hit. &nbsp;And it looked like
            it was going to be a doozy. &nbsp;As if to prove his point, a clap of thunder and simultaneous lightning
            strike, sounding like a close-range sonic boom, inspired a series of startled gasps and screams throughout
            the store and caused the senior woman in his line to drop her change purse, coins pinging and rolling across
            the floor. &nbsp;Elliott closed his eyes briefly and groaned. &nbsp;She was his last customer. &nbsp;She was
            only buying a quart of buttermilk. &nbsp;Now he was going to have to chase her money across the
            floor.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She looked up at him apologetically, and Elliott smiled, sighing.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay, ma&rsquo;am. &nbsp;You wait here,&rdquo; he said, automatically keying in his
            log-out code on the register.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so sorry, young man,&rdquo; the woman muttered shakily, looking down
            at the scattered change, &ldquo;that was just such a &ndash;&ldquo; She stopped as a new noise invaded the
            store. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh dear,&rdquo; she said simply.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott followed her gaze to the window. &nbsp;Hail the size of gumballs was raining
            down on the cars in the parking lot. &nbsp;Elliott just stood and watched it hitting the pavement and
            bouncing back up six to twelve inches and suddenly was glad he hadn&rsquo;t left yet, since his method of
            transportation was an old ten-speed bicycle.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Walking around his conveyor station, Elliott sighed again and bent over to retrieve
            the woman&rsquo;s change. &nbsp;He wondered how long he would have to stay at the store while the storm
            rolled over the area. &nbsp;Texas weather may change fast, but there were some storms that just seem to
            favor a place and hang around for a good long while.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sound of the hail seemed to get louder. &nbsp;As Elliott was standing to look, he
            heard a distant but building sound of a siren. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">What now, he wondered, and then so many things happened in such quick succession that
            time tried to compensate by moving everything into a type of surreal slow motion. &nbsp;As Elliott stood, he
            saw that the hail was much larger, realized the siren was the weather warning station at the edge of town,
            saw the panic-stricken face of a man running along the outside windows, looking over his shoulder, and then
            the sound of a rushing freight train deafened him as he saw cars being lifted in the parking lot, spinning
            and crashing against each other, one of them smashing into the running man as he reached the doors of the
            store. &nbsp;Elliott saw blood on the glass doors which were trying to open, then saw the entire car coming
            through the front wall, the windows blowing out. &nbsp;Suddenly, he was getting wet. &nbsp;He looked up to
            see the roof peeling off the building. &nbsp;The last thing he saw was the outside wall leaning in and
            bricks flying off the top as if being pinged by the finger of an angry giant.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Mercifully, he felt nothing.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal Nixon rubbed his eyes and shook his head. &nbsp;That storm had hit fast and
            furious, and he was certain a tornado had hit the store, but things were bright now. &nbsp;Amazing how
            quickly these things passed. &nbsp;He looked around him. &nbsp;It was hard to make out his surroundings
            exactly. &nbsp;He rubbed his eyes again. &nbsp;Where exactly was the store? &nbsp;Slightly ahead of him and
            to his left, a woman walked slowly, looking around. &nbsp;When she saw him, she jumped, her eyes
            wide.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where is everything?&rdquo; she asked, her voice nearly as small as she was.
            &nbsp;She looked like a left-over flower child, small, wearing a nearly floor-length skirt, her long
            straight hair hanging down her back.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal shrugged. &nbsp;He ran his hand over his thinning hair and stopped.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said weakly.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal turned at the sound. &nbsp;Another woman was walking up behind them.
            &nbsp;Wearing a navy blue business suit and heels, she was frowning as she marched quickly up to
            them.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s going on here?&rdquo; she demanded. &nbsp;I was just in the store
            and there was a commotion and now. . . &ldquo; &nbsp;She looked around angrily. &nbsp;&ldquo;Where is the
            store?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal and the other woman looked at her blankly.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just then a young man joined them, seemingly from out of nowhere. &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you
            guys have any idea what&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; he asked. &nbsp;&ldquo;Was there a tornado?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal nodded. &nbsp;&ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;But. . . I just
            have no idea. . .&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The small woman continued to look around timidly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Did we get blown out
            of the store?&rdquo; she asked.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">They all looked at her with raised eyebrows, but no one had an answer. &nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">They were standing in a field or a yard which alone was strange since the Handy Dandy
            was in the center of town. &nbsp;The grass was high, but only we-should-have-mowed-it-a-few-days-ago high.
            &nbsp;The area was fairly open, some trees interspersed throughout, but none too close by. &nbsp;Pockets of
            pink, violet, and yellow wildflowers dotted the field.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that up ahead?&rdquo; the woman in the heels said.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other three looked and saw a house in the distance, a few hundred yards off. Hal
            slowly turned in a circle, checking the horizon. &nbsp;There was simply nothing else around them.
            &nbsp;Shrugging again, he began walking toward the house, the other three following him
            automatically.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The house was a two-story country farmhouse. &nbsp;It was yellow with white trim and
            a porch which ran the length of the house. &nbsp;There were white shutters at each paned window, two sets on
            each level of the house. &nbsp;The yard around it was manicured neatly, flowers blooming profusely around
            two large trees in the front yard, along the walk leading up to the porch steps, and in large multi-colored
            arrays on either side of the steps, stretching the length of the porch. &nbsp;Rather than neat little
            individual patches of flowers, the gardens were a cacophony of color and size and texture. &nbsp;There was
            no one in sight.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The four stopped at the bottom of the porch steps.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is weird,&rdquo; the young man said, echoing in one way or another
            everyone&rsquo;s thoughts.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Want me to knock?&rdquo; Hal asked, looking at the others.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The small woman simply raised her eyebrows. &nbsp;The young man and high-heeled woman
            shrugged, the man gesturing a go-ahead toward the door.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal swallowed, then climbed the stairs. &nbsp;As he was lifting his hand to rap on
            the door, he saw a paper which had apparently been shut into the door. &nbsp;Looking back over his shoulder
            first, he gripped the paper and tugged lightly. &nbsp;It pulled easily from the door. &nbsp;When he read it,
            he turned to the others, his face a picture of confusion.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; the heeled woman demanded.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Hal said, looking back down at the small paper, &ldquo;it says,
            &lsquo;Come in and make yourselves at home.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The three looked at each other, then back up at Hal.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Us?&rdquo; asked the young man. &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, . . . Well, I don&rsquo;t
            know what I mean.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh look,&rdquo; said the woman in the suit suddenly, &ldquo;I seem to have
            dropped my cell phone and I simply </span><span class="c4">have</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to call my
            station. &nbsp;I say let&rsquo;s pretend the note&rsquo;s for us and go in. &nbsp;We can always plead
            ignorance later.&rdquo; &nbsp;She was already marching up the steps.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal&rsquo;s face stretched into an expression of uncertainty, but stepped aside as
            the woman approached, and allowed her to open the door and go in. &nbsp;The others hesitantly
            followed.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The interior of the house wasn&rsquo;t exactly what the foursome expected.
            &nbsp;Rather than the quaint country style anticipated, the inside was much more contemporary. &nbsp;There
            was no foyer, but rather the door opened into the living area, a large room with black, soft leather
            furnishings on a cherry hardwood floor. &nbsp;The room spanned the length of the house. &nbsp;A stairway
            went up from the left of the door. &nbsp;They could see only as far as the first landing. &nbsp;Books lined
            shelves built into the right wall, small sculptures and other pieces or art interspersed among the books.
            &nbsp;In the center of the shelves was a type of alcove holding what looked like a state-of-the-art stereo
            system. &nbsp;At the back of the room was a large arched doorway that opened into a kitchen and dining room
            combination. &nbsp;The lighter colors of that room reflected the light in such a way that it appeared almost
            to glow.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Cool,&rdquo; the young man said simply and walked toward the stereo. &nbsp;The
            small woman moved toward the carpeted stairs and began creeping up them, calling tentatively,
            &ldquo;Hello?&rdquo; The other woman&rsquo;s heels clumped against the floor as she headed for the kitchen,
            apparently in search of a telephone. &nbsp;Hal stood just inside the door, looking around him. &nbsp;A large
            black leather couch, two matching overstuffed wing-back chairs facing it, took up the center of the room.
            &nbsp;The furniture was placed around an oversized round coffee table, wrought iron and glass, which sat on
            a small area rug with a woven geometric pattern of beiges and blacks. &nbsp;Suddenly exhausted, Hal walked
            over to the wingback chair nearest to him, stepped around it, then dropped down into it, his back now to the
            door and the stairway. &nbsp;The chair felt as if it had been made for him. &nbsp;Sighing, he sank down into
            it, stretching his legs out in front of him.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, there is no phone in the kitchen,&rdquo; the woman said sharply, her
            hand on her hip as he marched back into the room. &nbsp;&ldquo;Is there one in here?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo; asked the young man turning away from the stereo.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A. Phone,&rdquo; she said pointedly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you see a
            phone?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young man looked from side to side around him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Guess not,&rdquo; he
            said, then went back to looking through what appeared to be an extensive collection of compact discs.
            &nbsp;The woman sighed, dropped down on the couch across from Hal and frowned at him. &nbsp;&ldquo;I have to
            call my station,&rdquo; she said.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know,&rdquo; he said, trying to sound sympathetic.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a moment, the young man said, almost to himself, &ldquo;These are like my
            favorite cds.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; the woman barked.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The young man looked over his left shoulder at her. &nbsp;&ldquo;These cds.
            &nbsp;Like every one of my favorites is in here. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s wild.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The woman looked at Hal, lifted one eyebrow, and shook her head, rolling her eyes
            slightly. &nbsp;Hal just shrugged and leaned back in the chair. &nbsp;He could sleep here. &nbsp;A minute
            later he was startled when from behind him he heard a small voice say, &ldquo;Candace?&rdquo; &nbsp;The
            petite woman had come back down the stairs and was standing behind him.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The woman on the couch frowned. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes?&rdquo; she said impatiently.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; Hal said, turning in the chair and looking around the side,
            &ldquo;how did you know her name?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before she could answer, the woman on the couch said, &ldquo;She recognized me, of
            course. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m a news reporter for KKTV.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The look on the small woman&rsquo;s face caused Hal to not look away from her.
            &nbsp;Her already light complexion was very pale now, her eyes so wide he could almost see white all the way
            around them. &nbsp;A redness had begun on her throat and seemed to be creeping up her neck. &nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;are you all right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her eyes slowly met his. &nbsp;&ldquo;Are you Harold,&rdquo; she asked, &ldquo;or
            Elliott?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal&rsquo;s eyes widened and he slowly stood up from the chair. &nbsp;He glanced over
            at the young man by the stereo who was now staring at the obviously frightened woman.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Uh, well, my name is Harold,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;People call me
            Hal,&rdquo; he added, feeling foolish. &nbsp;&ldquo;But how--?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She looked over at the young man. &nbsp;&ldquo;And you are Elliott?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He nodded, silent.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She turned her ever-reddening face to the woman on the couch. &nbsp;&ldquo;I
            don&rsquo;t watch television,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never seen you before.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace&rsquo;s face went from annoyed to a delayed surprise. &nbsp;&ldquo;So then
            how--?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said the woman, &ldquo;you guys need to come upstairs.&rdquo;
            &nbsp;Then she turned and walked back up the stairs. &nbsp;The others all hesitated just a fraction of a
            second, then bolted from their positions to follow her.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were eight steps up to the landing, which then took a 45-degree turn to the
            right, another ten stairs completing the climb to the second floor. &nbsp;They were at the end of the hall.
            &nbsp;At the far end was an open door, a tile floor and shelves visible, obviously a restroom. &nbsp;On each
            side of the carpeted hall were two closed bedroom doors. &nbsp;The small woman stepped quickly over to the
            first door on the right. &nbsp;She pointed to a small sign positioned on the door at eye level.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is me,&rdquo; she said quietly. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other three moved to look. &nbsp;The sign on the door said,
            &ldquo;Ariadne.&rdquo; &nbsp;They looked at her quizzically and she waved her hand down the hall, inviting
            them to look.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before long there was a chorus of &ldquo;heys&rdquo; as each of the other three found
            a door with their name on it. &nbsp;As shocking as even that would have been, the signs were not mere paper
            markers. &nbsp;Permanently affixed to each door were bronze plaques, each engraved with one of their names.
            &nbsp;The four turned away from the doors and stared at each other. &nbsp;Finally Elliott once again
            essentially voiced everyone&rsquo;s thoughts.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this is really starting to freak me
            out.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c15" id="h.30j0zll"><span class="c13">Chapter 2</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, this is ridiculous!&rdquo; &nbsp; Candace Richards was the first to
            exclaim, quickly opening the door with her name on it and bursting into the room.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She stood, dumbfounded, looking around, her mouth uncharacteristically opened in
            shock. &nbsp;The room was perfect. &nbsp;Better than her bedroom in her condo, it was the picture of what
            she was trying for with each shopping trip and on-line catalog. &nbsp;The colors were muted mauves and
            violets with ivory accents. &nbsp;The bed was an oversized four-poster in a rich, dark wood colors.
            &nbsp;The pictures, in simple black or silver frames, were Ansel Adams replicas in black and white.
            &nbsp;There was a desk pulled away from one wall, a high-back swivel office chair behind it. &nbsp;The desk
            appeared to hold complete office supplies and a laptop computer. &nbsp;No phone.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rushing to the laptop, she turned it on. &nbsp;It fired up immediately, the icons
            boasting of her favorite music site, word processing program, and photos. &nbsp;Curious, she checked the
            photo program and found all the photos she had uploaded at home. &nbsp;There was, however, no internet
            connection. &nbsp;Candace frowned, leaning back in the chair and swiveling to look at the room. &nbsp;What
            was this place. . . ?</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Next to her room, at the stairway end of the hall, Harold &ldquo;Hal&rdquo; slowly
            wandered through the room apparently designated for him. &nbsp;He was amazed at how comfortable he felt in
            the room, although, at 45, he could not remember ever having designed or arranged a room himself.
            &nbsp;Going from his parents house to the one he shared with his wife, he had always gladly left decorating
            decisions up to the women in his life. &nbsp;But, he conceded, if he </span><span class="c4">had</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;designed a room. . . this would be it. &nbsp;The furniture was dark, the colors rich.
            &nbsp;There was a stereo and a wall-to-wall bookshelf lined with leather-bound books and records. &nbsp;Not
            cds, records. &nbsp;And no modern technology anywhere. &nbsp;No computer or this-pad or that-phone.
            &nbsp;Just books and records. &nbsp;Hal smiled and started toward the shelves to check titles, but he knew
            he was going to like what he saw.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Across the hall, Elliott Prescott let out a squeal of delight. &nbsp;Smiling large,
            turning in a circle and looking around &ldquo;his&rdquo; room, he held his arms out in joy. &nbsp;For at
            least half of his twenty-four years, Elliott had dreamed of being a musician. &nbsp;Well, actually, he
            argued, he </span><span class="c4">was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a musician, it was just that no one else
            seemed to know that yet. &nbsp;The room he was standing in was beyond his greatest imagination. &nbsp;Lining
            one wall was a series of guitars, electric and acoustic, all his favorite types, some of which he would
            never have dreamed of handling. &nbsp;In the corner was a large and very powerful amp system.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Barely noticing the futon, apartment fridge, and small stereo with cds, Elliott
            picked up the Fender twelve-string and walked, as if mesmerized, over to the amp. &nbsp;He plugged the cord
            into the guitar, cranked up the dial on the amp, and with a wicked grin, hit the strings, a G-chord blasting
            with perfect clarity out of the speakers. &nbsp;He did a quick run down the frets and never squawked a note,
            even when his fingers on the frets and on the strings were so close he had to maneuver his hands to fit them
            both on. &nbsp;When he stopped, he grinned again. &nbsp;That was the loudest he&rsquo;d played in a while
            and his ears weren&rsquo;t even numb.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">This place rocks, Elliott thought, dropping happily into the nearby papasan chair,
            hugging the Fender up against him.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne Greene sat on the edge of the bed, her heels hooked on the bed frame, her
            hands on her knees. &nbsp;A tear coursed slowly down her cheek. &nbsp;Although she didn&rsquo;t look her
            years, Ariadne was nearly fifty, and had pretty much decorated her home just the way she wanted it.
            &nbsp;Having lived alone for much of her adult life, she had the opportunities and resources to make any
            decision she cared to about the d&eacute;cor of her home. &nbsp;Her bedroom was exactly as she wanted it,
            earthy, sparse, comfortable, understated. &nbsp;The room she sat in now was nothing like her real room.
            &nbsp;And this room was perfect.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne looked around her in wonder. &nbsp;The room was bright yellow, with fabrics
            in pastel florals, delicate and lacy. &nbsp;The bed was brass with simple rounded knobs. &nbsp;There was a
            corner with a white wicker rocker, a colorful throw draped across the back. &nbsp;On the floor next to it
            was a large wicker basket filled with yarns in nearly every color. &nbsp;In the corner by the window was a
            large easel, a table next to it holding a large supply of paints, brushes, cloths, and other artist
            supplies. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Overcome by the beauty and the perfection of the room, Ariadne pulled her feet up on
            the bed, hugging her knees against her chest, another tear sliding down her face, her eyes
            glistening.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eventually, the four wandered back into the hall of the second floor. &nbsp;There was
            silence until Elliott came out of his room apologizing.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I know that was loud,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve never played on
            one of those before and I&mdash;&ldquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; Candace interrupted him.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The guitar,&rdquo; he said, pointing with his thumb over his shoulder.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;It was&mdash;&ldquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t hear anything,&rdquo; she said, frowning at him.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott&rsquo;s eyebrows went up. &nbsp;Whoa, he thought, great soundproofing.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal cleared his throat. &nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s, uh, go downstairs,&rdquo; he said,
            &ldquo;and try to make some sense of all this.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">As they walked down the stairs, Candace said, &ldquo;Did anyone find a phone in their
            rooms?&rdquo; &nbsp;Silence answered her.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">When they reached the living room, Hal and Ariadne automatically took the chairs,
            Candace and Elliott moving right to the couch. &nbsp;Elliott put his feet up on the glass-topped table, not
            noticing the disapproving glance from Candace.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Elliott said, smiling, &ldquo;what is this place?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace rolled her eyes. &nbsp;At thirty-one, she knew she wasn&rsquo;t the oldest
            here, but she sure felt like it. &nbsp;Brushing her blonde hair back from her face, she said,
            &ldquo;Obviously, none of us knows what this place is,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Were we all in the
            store when the tornado hit?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne pulled her waist-length hair around her shoulder and let it drape down the
            front of her. &nbsp;Too small for her feet to touch the floor, she curled her legs sideways in the chair.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;The Handy Dandy, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone nodded.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I work there,&rdquo; Elliott said. &nbsp;Then, his voice smaller, added,
            &ldquo;I saw a guy get killed by a car, then the roof coming off, then. . . Well, then I was
            here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was silence for a moment, then Hal said, &ldquo;I was in the back, at the deli.
            &nbsp;I saw the doors to the back room blow in, toward the store. &nbsp;At least two guys in the white
            aprons came flying through. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t think they. . . Well. . .&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne had leaned around the wingback side of her chair to watch Hal. &nbsp;She
            nodded, knowingly. &nbsp;&ldquo;I saw an older couple looking for a place to go&hellip; for protection.
            &nbsp;Just as they went around an aisle, the shelves fell toward them.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace was frowning. &nbsp;&ldquo;I saw a mother grabbing up her two little kids.
            &nbsp;When the roof started to go, I didn&rsquo;t see them anymore. &nbsp; Then,&rdquo; she added, looking
            around at the others, &ldquo;then I was here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was silence again.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are we dead?&rdquo; &nbsp;It was Elliott.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal frowned and shook his head. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel dead,&rdquo; he said.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, not sure how that does feel, but wouldn&rsquo;t there be pearly gates, streets of gold,
            and angels?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne was watching him intently. &nbsp;&ldquo;&rsquo;To be absent from the body is
            to be present with the Lord,&rsquo;&rdquo; she quoted. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the Lord anywhere
            here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; Candace chimed in, her legs crossed and one foot
            swinging almost violently. &nbsp;&ldquo;This is a nice house, but it&rsquo;s certainly not Heaven.
            &nbsp;There&rsquo;s not even internet.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You think there&rsquo;s internet in Heaven?&rdquo; Ariadne asked, no ridicule
            in her tone.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace shrugged impatiently. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no way to contact anyone or find
            out anything &ndash; no television, phones, internet. . .&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Maybe it&rsquo;s purgatory,&rdquo; Elliott suggested, his eyes wide.
            &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace made a sound of disgust. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe in
            purgatory,&rdquo; she said, dismissing the idea. &nbsp;&ldquo;And besides, isn&rsquo;t that supposed to be a
            bad place?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott shrugged. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, it was Ariadne who voiced the question they were avoiding. &nbsp;&ldquo;What
            are we going to do?&rdquo; she asked. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After an awkward silence, Hal placed his hands on his knees and pushed himself up.
            &nbsp;Just over six feet, his 220 pounds more excess than toned, he looked around at the others.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to go outside,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to see what else is
            around here. &nbsp;You all stay here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Ariadne said, surprising everyone. &nbsp;&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t
            leave us here!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal looked at her. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m coming back,&rdquo; he said patiently.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come back and let you know whatever I found. &nbsp;We can&rsquo;t make a decision
            without information.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;The other three looked at each other, then back at Hal who waited.
            &nbsp;Finally, Candace said, &ldquo;Well, we don&rsquo;t appear to have any better ideas, so go
            ahead.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Be careful,&rdquo; Ariadne added.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott stood up. &nbsp;&ldquo;Should I go with you?&rdquo; he asked. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal shook his head. &nbsp;&ldquo;No, I think you should wait here. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll
            be back.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The women stood up and all of them followed Hal to the door and onto the front porch.
            &nbsp;Stretching, he looked around. &nbsp;It was a beautiful day. &nbsp;The sun was bright without being
            blinding, occasional clouds dotting the sky, a very slight breeze keeping the air cool. &nbsp;Perfect
            day.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We came from that way,&rdquo; he said, pointing. &nbsp;&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ll
            try going that way.&rdquo; &nbsp;He pointed to the back of the house. &nbsp;He turned and looked at the
            three others. &nbsp;&ldquo;Any of you guys Christians?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Three sets of eyebrows went up at the question. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, yeah,&rdquo; Elliott said, nodding.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne blushed and nodded.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace frowned and crossed her arms. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what that has
            to do with anything. &nbsp;But yes, I am, why?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal nodded. &nbsp;&ldquo;Me too. &nbsp; So pray. &nbsp;Pray we can figure this out
            and hopefully get back to our lives and families.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were silent nods of agreement, the three staying on the porch and watching as
            Hal walked down the steps and around the side of the house, quickly going out of sight. &nbsp;The three
            sighed and, turning, went back into the house. &nbsp;Ariadne dropped back into the chair, Candace paced the
            room, and Elliott went to the stereo. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You guys mind if I put on some music?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The women shrugged.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thinking twice, Candace opened her mouth to suggest it not be too loud, but Elliott
            had already placed the cd and was pushing the button. &nbsp;Clamping her mouth shut in frustration, she was
            soon surprised to hear the sounds coming from the stereo. &nbsp;It was an easy jazz tune, heavy on piano and
            bass. &nbsp;Elliott adjusted the sound and the bass came out more clearly.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;One day, I&rsquo;ll be able to play like that,&rdquo; he muttered. &nbsp;As he
            turned away from the system, he looked at the door, surprised. &nbsp;The women followed his gaze.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal was walking in the door, his face flushed.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Back so soon?&rdquo; Candace said.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal&rsquo;s face registered shock. &nbsp;&ldquo;&rsquo;So soon&rsquo;?&rdquo; he
            said. &nbsp;&ldquo;What do you mean &lsquo;so soon&rsquo;? &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been gone for
            hours!&rdquo;</span></p>

    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c5 c6"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Back in the living room, all in the same positions as before, it didn&rsquo;t take
            Hal long to tell his story. &nbsp;He had walked, using what he knew from his boy scout days &ndash; the sun,
            the trees ahead, the house behind &ndash; to make sure he walked in as straight a line as possible.
            &nbsp;After awhile he could no longer see the house and there was nothing ahead of him. &nbsp;He kept
            walking, amazed that as out-of-shape as he was he never got winded or tired, determined not to turn back
            until he found </span><span class="c4">something</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;Finally he saw a building up
            ahead. &nbsp;Picking up the pace, he walked more quickly than he thought he could toward the
            structure.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was the yellow house again.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re the only thing on a very small world,&rdquo; he
            said, his legs stretched out in front of him. &nbsp;&ldquo;There was nothing, </span><span
            class="c4">nothing</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;else out there.&rdquo; &nbsp;He looked around at the other
            three. &nbsp;&ldquo;Just us,&rdquo; he added, knowing how ominous it sounded. &nbsp;&ldquo;I walked and
            walked and ended up back here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And yet,&rdquo; Ariadne added quietly, &ldquo;very little time had passed for
            us. &nbsp;We had just come back inside and sat down when you walked in the door.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal&rsquo;s eyes widened. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Freaky,&rdquo; Elliott said.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was a long silence, then Elliott added, &ldquo;Maybe this </span><span
            class="c4">is</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Purgatory.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace rolled her eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pulling her feet up into the chair, hugging her arms around her knees, Ariadne said,
            her voice even smaller than before, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting scared.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal frowned over at her. &nbsp;&ldquo;There&rsquo;s just no . . . I don&rsquo;t know,
            there&rsquo;s no explanation for all this! &nbsp;I mean, it&rsquo;s like we&rsquo;re trapped here, yet I
            don&rsquo;t feel too. . .&rdquo; he gestured with his hands, &ldquo;worried, I guess. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s nice
            here. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t feel. . . I don&rsquo;t know, threatened. &nbsp;I mean, I want to get out, but not
            because I feel. . .&rdquo; He shook his head helplessly. &nbsp;Looking over at Ariadne, he said, &ldquo;Do
            you really feel scared?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She&rsquo;d been frowning thoughtfully as he talked. &nbsp;Slowly shaking her head,
            she hugged her knees closer. &nbsp;&ldquo;Actually, no. &nbsp;I think I just thought I </span><span
            class="c4">should</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;be scared. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m, well. . . &ldquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Freaked out?&rdquo; Elliott suggested.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne smiled. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she agreed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, freaked out
            pretty well defines it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace stood up suddenly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, let&rsquo;s see if it&rsquo;s heaven
            after all,&rdquo; she said, and headed around the couch toward the kitchen.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; Hal asked.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without looking back, she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s go see if
            the fridge is full of milk and the cabinets full of honey.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Several minutes later, they sat back in the living room, each with a plate holding
            some of their favorite foods. &nbsp;It hadn&rsquo;t surprised them to find the refrigerator and pantry
            filled with their individual top choices. &nbsp;On a whim, Elliott had checked the freezer and found each
            person&rsquo;s favorite ice cream. &nbsp;To his great delight, Hal had found a coffee maker and immediately
            began brewing a large pot of dark coffee. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He picked the mug up from the table beside the chair and drank a large mouthful of
            the brew. &nbsp;It was the best coffee he&rsquo;d ever had. &nbsp;Might </span><span
            class="c4">be</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;heaven, he thought, taking another swallow.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is that you&rsquo;re eating?&rdquo; Candace said to Ariadne.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Swallowing, the little woman looked down at her plate, then up at Candace on the
            couch. &nbsp;&ldquo;Um, fruit, cheese, hummus, wheat crackers&hellip;.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott took another mouthful of his roast beef on white bread sandwich, then said,
            his voice muffled by the food, &ldquo;You wan&rsquo; some of my beef?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne&rsquo;s face registered mild disgust. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t eat
            meat,&rdquo; she said.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace tipped her head, one eyebrow up. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I prefer salads and fruit
            myself, but I never turn down a good fillet.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; Hal said absently.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Steak?&rdquo; Ariadne said, her mild disgust apparently growing.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Cow?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott was in mid-bite and looked quickly from Candace next to him to Hal, his
            eyebrows up and eyes smiling. &nbsp;&ldquo;Moo,&rdquo; he said as he sunk his teeth into the
            sandwich.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ignoring him, Candace said, &ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong with steak?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne, looking repulsed now, sat her plate down on the table between her chair and
            Hal&rsquo;s. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a living thing,&rdquo; she said, shaking her head. &nbsp;&ldquo;It has
            a heart and a brain and feelings. &nbsp;Do you </span><span class="c4">know</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;what their living conditions are like? &nbsp;Do you have any idea what a slaughterhouse is
            like?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace looked amused, but Hal frowned. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve actually thought of
            that,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s easy to not think of it when you&rsquo;re ordering a
            20-ounce rib-eye.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Turning slightly to better look at him, Ariadne said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you ever
            worry about karma?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Karma!&rdquo; Candace practically spat out the word. &nbsp;&ldquo;What kind of
            new age thinking is that?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Karma is anything </span><span class="c4">but</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;new,&rdquo; Ariadne said. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a universal belief of cause and effect.
            &nbsp;What happens to us is caused by our own actions. &nbsp;And those actions create other affects for
            ourselves, our lives, and our very world. &nbsp;Eating a living being&hellip; that just creates a very
            negative karma that is already coming back on us with our high cholesterol, high blood pressure, weight
            problems, heart problems. &nbsp;One day we all pay for our bad choices.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; &ldquo;Well now, I agree with that part,&rdquo; Hal said, patting his stomach
            almost absently. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve made plenty of bad choices that I&rsquo;ve paid for. &nbsp;But I
            think that&rsquo;s all it is &ndash; bad choices. &nbsp;Not &lsquo;karma.&rsquo; &nbsp;Isn&rsquo;t that
            Buddhist or something?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne nodded. &nbsp;&ldquo;It plays a part in Buddhism as well as other eastern
            religions. &nbsp;I told you I&rsquo;m a Christian, and I wasn&rsquo;t kidding, but I think a concept like
            karma is universal, not just limited to the religions that call it by that name. &nbsp;We call it bad
            choices, bad luck, coincidence, destiny. &nbsp;But it all means the same thing.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was silence for a moment, then Candace, still staring at her, said, &ldquo;Were
            you given the name Ariadne at birth or did you change your name?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not sure how to take the question, Ariadne looked at her for a moment, then said,
            &ldquo;My mother gave it to me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Was she a flower child?&rdquo; Candace asked, her gaze not shifting.
            &nbsp;Elliott and Hal began to squirm uncomfortably.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne looked uneasy, then swallowed and sat up straighter in the chair, brushing
            her skirt down over her legs. &nbsp;When she spoke, her voice was clear. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, she was. &nbsp;My
            mother was a rebel from a young age. &nbsp;She spoke her mind when women weren&rsquo;t expected or allowed
            to do so. &nbsp;She took nothing for granted and accepted no answer without investigating it herself first.
            &nbsp;She was very serious about exploring her feelings and wouldn&rsquo;t do anything until she knew
            exactly how she felt about it. &nbsp;She embraced the hippie culture for its freedom and
            openness.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The others sat in stunned silence. &nbsp;Ariadne looked almost as if she no longer
            remembered they were there. &nbsp;She was looking off into the distance now. &nbsp;Her face was set,
            serious. &nbsp;It didn&rsquo;t appear that the memories she was recalling were necessarily pleasant ones.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;She had me alone, also a thing not done back then. &nbsp;She raised me alone. &nbsp;Just as I
            raised &nbsp;my daughter alone. &nbsp;Just as she is raising my granddaughter alone.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was a long silence. &nbsp;Ariadne cleared her throat, wiped her eyes, brushed
            her skirt down again. &nbsp;&ldquo;Karma,&rdquo; she said simply.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The first to speak was Elliott, in a quiet voice. &nbsp;&ldquo;You must really miss
            them a lot,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Your daughter and granddaughter.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne smiled over at him, her eyes glistening. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve missed them
            for a long time,&rdquo; she said simply. &nbsp;&ldquo;My daughter doesn&rsquo;t necessarily embrace the same
            ideas I do.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After an awkward moment, Ariadne said, &ldquo;How about you, Elliott? &nbsp;Who have
            you left behind?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Everyone in the room was rocked by the question. &nbsp;All of them had been thinking
            it, but no one had ventured to discuss it or bring it out in the open. &nbsp;Elliott seemed so shocked by
            the question, he didn&rsquo;t know how to answer.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a slight, awkward silence, Candace said loudly, an edge of anger in her voice,
            &ldquo;Well now, </span><span class="c4">that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;just brings up the elephant in
            the room, doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne, unfazed, looked over at her. &nbsp;&ldquo;It had to come up eventually,
            Candace. &nbsp;We don&rsquo;t know how long we&rsquo;re going to be here or if we&rsquo;re ever getting
            back.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal looked, surprised, at Ariadne. &nbsp;Little lady has more spunk than I gave her
            credit for, he thought. &nbsp;Clearing his throat, he said, &ldquo;I left a wife of twenty-one years and two
            kids. &nbsp;My daughter Melanie, Mellie, is sixteen. &nbsp;My son, Steven, is nineteen. &nbsp;They both live
            at home.&rdquo; &nbsp;He hung his arm up over the winged side of the chair, his hand higher than his head.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;That gives me some comfort,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;They live at home and maybe their mom
            won&rsquo;t be so-- &nbsp;That is, will maybe handle all this better.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott sat his plate down on the coffee table, his sandwich unfinished.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;I had a girlfriend,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Her name is Stormy and she&rsquo;s the best.
            &nbsp;Plays the most wicked drums you&rsquo;ve ever heard. &nbsp;Skinny little thing, but we&rsquo;ve never
            had to mike the drums when we did a gig together. &nbsp;She&rsquo;s amazing.&rdquo; &nbsp;He paused.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;But she&rsquo;s beautiful and talented. &nbsp;She&rsquo;ll find someone else. &nbsp;My Dad is
            mister tough guy. &nbsp;My mom, though, . . . She&rsquo;s going to take this hard.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace slammed her cup of coffee down on the table in front of her, the last of the
            coffee sloshing up and over the side. &nbsp;Ignoring it, she barked, &ldquo;Going to take </span><span
            class="c4">what</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;hard, Elliott? &nbsp;And,&rdquo; she said angrily, looking at
            Hal, &ldquo;your wife is going to handle </span><span class="c4">what</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;better?
            &nbsp;We don&rsquo;t know what this </span><span class="c4">is</span><span class="c0">!&rdquo; she said,
            each word punctuated as if it were a sentence all its own. &nbsp;&ldquo;You people are sitting here reading
            off your own obituaries and we don&rsquo;t even know that we&rsquo;re dead! &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t </span><span
            class="c4">feel</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;dead! &nbsp;Do dead people drink coffee? &nbsp;Do dead people
            eat real food?&rdquo; &nbsp;She poked her fingers into her shoulders and chest. &nbsp;&ldquo;I can
        </span><span class="c4">feel</span><span class="c0">, my body is </span><span class="c4">real</span><span
            class="c0">! &nbsp;We even have to go to the bathroom, for goodness sake! &nbsp;Do you really think they
            have plumbing in the afterlife?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was another stunned silence, interrupted by a giggle. &nbsp;The other three all
            turned and looked at Elliott, his hand over his mouth, his eyes sparkling. &nbsp;He dropped his hand down
            from his smiling mouth. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, she&rsquo;s got a point,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Of all the
            things I expect to do in heaven, going potty isn&rsquo;t one of them. &nbsp;I mean, seems like that would be
            sort of taken care of, you know? &nbsp;I mean&mdash;&ldquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay, Elliott,&rdquo; Hal said, smiling and waving his hand.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay. &nbsp;We get it.&rdquo; &nbsp;Looking at Candace, he said, &ldquo;Fact is, Candace -- Can
            I call you Candy?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Looking aghast, she said, &ldquo;Absolutely not.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Eyebrows lifted, Hal nodded and said, &ldquo;Okay, Candace, fact is we don&rsquo;t
            have any way of knowing where we are. &nbsp;There doesn&rsquo;t seem to be much we can do about it.
            &nbsp;But it also appears that all of our comforts have been considered and met, so. . .&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So what?&rdquo; she said, crossing her arms and legs, one foot
            swinging.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, I guess we just, well, wait.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait?&rdquo; she said, her foot swinging faster. &nbsp;&ldquo;Wait for
            what?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal cleared his throat, looked to the other two for support. &nbsp;He shifted
            uncomfortably in the chair. &nbsp;&ldquo;Wait. . . well, </span><span class="c4">until</span><span
            class="c0">.&rdquo; He shrugged, his arms out to the side. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know until what or for
            what. &nbsp;But it seems we&rsquo;re meant to be here, I think we all believe God has something to do with
            it, so we just wait here until He shows us what it&rsquo;s all about. &nbsp;What this is all about.
            &nbsp;Why we&rsquo;re. . . here,&rdquo; he finished weakly, his arms dropping down. &nbsp;&ldquo;If you
            think about it,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s not like we have much choice. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t see
            anything else we </span><span class="c4">can</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;do. &nbsp;Do you?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace was staring at him, her arms still crossed, her foot still bouncing.
            &nbsp;Her face had begun to turn red and a strain had come into her eyes. &nbsp;Ariadne leaned forward in
            her chair. &nbsp;&ldquo;Candace, are you okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Turning her head rapidly toward Ariadne, Candace practically yelled, &ldquo;Yes!
            &nbsp;I&rsquo;m just fine!&rdquo; &nbsp;Standing suddenly, without another word, she swept up her plate and
            mug and marched quickly into the kitchen.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The men looked at Ariadne who gazed toward the kitchen, her eyes soft with sympathy.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;She was about to cry,&rdquo; she whispered. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think she does that
            often. &nbsp;Or well.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott looked frightened. &nbsp;&ldquo;What should we do?&rdquo; he asked in a stage
            whisper.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; Ariadne whispered back, smiling.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sound of Candace&rsquo;s heals got louder and they looked up to find her walking
            back in the room, her face once again composed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;so what do we do
            around here for entertainment?&rdquo; &nbsp;Sitting back on the couch, she turned to Elliott.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;How about turning on some more of that music of yours?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott frowned and looked at her as if he hadn&rsquo;t understood her. &nbsp;Then he
            looked slowly over at Hal and Ariadne. &nbsp;He lifted up his hand and looked at it like he&rsquo;d never
            seen it before. &nbsp;His eyes widened as he turned his hand in front of his face.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elliott?&rdquo; Hal said. &nbsp;&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I feel. . . weird,&rdquo; Elliott said, running his hands up and down his
            chest, then down his legs, then up and down his arms. &nbsp;&ldquo;I feel like I&rsquo;m. . . &ldquo; He
            looked up, his face a picture of confusion. &nbsp;&ldquo;I just feel weird.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Candace had been looking at Elliott and now was jumping up from
            the couch. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; she said again, pointing at him.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal and Ariadne stood quickly, staring at Elliott, afraid to approach him. &nbsp;He
            seemed to be slowly disappearing right before their eyes. &nbsp;As they stared, he began to look less
            three-dimensional and more like a fading photograph. &nbsp;They gasped and Ariadne reached her hands out
            toward him as he became so transparent the couch could be seen through him.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening?&rdquo; Elliott said.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he disappeared all together.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>

    <p class="c15" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c13">Chapter 4</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry there, hun, I didn&rsquo;t see you come in. &nbsp;What can I get
            you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott looked toward the voice, then around him. &nbsp;He was sitting on a barstool
            at a counter in what appeared to be a bar or nightclub. &nbsp;A middle-aged woman with bright red hair
            pinned into a piled up-do and matching bright red lipstick was eyeing him curiously from the other side of
            the bar. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You okay there, hun?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott opened his mouth, but could only clamp it shut again. &nbsp;He held his hands
            up in front of him, turning them slowly. &nbsp;They looked normal again. &nbsp;Wow, he thought, what a rush!
            &nbsp;As he sat in the living room with the other three, he had begun to feel fuzzy and lightheaded.
            &nbsp;His body had gotten tingly and numb. &nbsp;Then he had felt as if he was losing consciousness.
            &nbsp;But before he fully passed out, he began to feel less tingly and numb, more focused, and now here he
            sat, in this unknown place with the woman now frowning at him suspiciously, her head tipped to one side, one
            raised eyebrow threatening to disappear into her hairline.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I, uh,&rdquo; he cleared his throat and shook his head, the last of the
            tingles gone. &nbsp;&ldquo;Can I get, um, a ginger ale?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The woman continued to look at him for another moment, sizing up his sanity, no
            doubt, he thought, then slowly nodded her head.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ginger ale. &nbsp;Right.&rdquo; &nbsp;She turned and walked away, down the
            length of the bar.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott looked around. &nbsp;The place was dim, but he could make out several tables
            behind him, booths on the opposite wall, the windows above them tinted slightly. &nbsp;Elliott could make
            out the backwards painting on the windows and reversed it in his head. &nbsp;&ldquo;Gerda&rsquo;s,&rdquo; it
            proclaimed simply. &nbsp;There was only one couple sitting at one of the booths and an older man hunched
            over a glass at one of the tables. &nbsp;With Elliott&rsquo;s back to the bar, the door was to his left.
            &nbsp;At the far end of the room, to his right, was a stage. &nbsp;There was an electric keyboard, an
            acoustic guitar leaning in a stand, a drum set, and three mikes on stands. &nbsp;Elliott tipped his head
            curiously. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Open mike night.&rdquo; &nbsp;It was the red-headed woman, back with his
            ginger ale. &nbsp;&ldquo;You a musician?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott&rsquo;s eyes widened. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well. . . yes,&rdquo; he said.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Um&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The woman leaned her elbows on the bar and peered at Elliott. &nbsp;&ldquo;You never
            been here before, have you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; he said, picking up the drink and taking a sip. &nbsp;&ldquo;Um,
            where is this exactly?&rdquo; He inwardly cringed at how the question must sound. &nbsp;Sure enough, the
            woman&rsquo;s eyebrow went up into her red hair again.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, now, hun, you are in Gerda&rsquo;s. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m Gerda.&rdquo; She
            smiled at him, but the smile was more pitying than kind. &nbsp;&ldquo;Welcome.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott took another swallow of the ginger ale. &nbsp;&ldquo;Thanks.&rdquo; &nbsp;He
            tried to think of a way to word what he wanted to ask without her calling authorities carrying long-sleeved
            white jackets. &nbsp;&ldquo;Um,&rdquo; he began again, &ldquo;and this place is. . . where?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now both eyebrows went up. &nbsp;&ldquo;You mean what street? &nbsp;You don&rsquo;t
            know what street you&rsquo;re on? &nbsp;Honey, you been to how many other bars today?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott deflated a little. &nbsp;What did he have to lose? &nbsp;&ldquo;Actually, I
            was wondering what city this is.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gerda stood up straight, stared at him a moment, then bent again with her elbows on
            the bar. &nbsp;She was wearing a scoop-necked sweater, too much of her showing when she leaned forward like
            that. &nbsp;Elliott kept his eyes on her face, heavily made up in an attempt to hide the lines of age that
            were beginning to show. &nbsp;Her look was one of amused curiosity.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been in this business a long time,&rdquo; she said.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;And that question is a first for me.&rdquo; She smiled, her mouth tilting slightly to one side.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Dallas, hun. &nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Texas</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;Dallas,
            Texas.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott felt a surge of electricity. &nbsp;So close to home! &nbsp;&ldquo;What day is
            it?&rdquo; he said, excitement in his voice.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gerda just shook her head, still smiling. &nbsp;&ldquo;Thursday, Hun.
            May&mdash;&ldquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thursday!&rdquo; &nbsp;Elliott looked around him eagerly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you
            have a phone I can use?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gerda continued to eye him like an amusing zoo exhibit. &nbsp;&ldquo;The pay phone
            has been broken forever. &nbsp;Store phone is on the fritz. &nbsp;Must be that storm system moving
            in.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The storm! &nbsp;&ldquo;How about a cell phone?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gerda jerked her thumb over her right shoulder without turning around. &nbsp;Elliott
            leaned slightly to look around her. &nbsp;A hand-drawn sign on the wall said, &ldquo;No cell phone
            zone.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hate those things,&rdquo; Gerda said.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott frowned, then realized that he didn&rsquo;t know what he would have done with
            a phone anyway. &nbsp;Call who? &nbsp;About what? &nbsp;As Gerda patted his arm and walked slowly away
            again, Elliott frowned and took another swallow of the soda. &nbsp;It was the same day as the storm.
            &nbsp;The storm hadn&rsquo;t hit yet. &nbsp;How was that possible? &nbsp;Elliott shook his head. &nbsp;So
            many unexplainable things had happened lately, that particular question had become a waste of time.
            &nbsp;Elliott looked around again. &nbsp;He was </span><span class="c4">put</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;here. &nbsp;Of that he was certain. &nbsp;So why was he here? &nbsp;Was it to warn people
            of the incoming storm? &nbsp;If that was the reason, wouldn&rsquo;t he be back in the Handy Dandy?
            &nbsp;Elliott frowned again. &nbsp;Maybe this place had been hard hit by the storm, too. &nbsp;Was he their
            warning system? &nbsp;Just these four people?</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott sighed and looked around anxiously. &nbsp;It was even dimmer in the bar now.
            &nbsp;The storm clouds must be moving in. &nbsp;Elliott bit his lower lip. &nbsp;Eyeing the door, he
            wondered if he should leave. &nbsp;Maybe he was supposed to go back to the store. &nbsp;But why then
            wasn&rsquo;t he just &ldquo;placed&rdquo; in the store? &nbsp;Maybe he was being given a chance to go home
            and start over. &nbsp;Maybe he wasn&rsquo;t meant to be at the store during the storm and this was his
            chance to have a re-do on his day. &nbsp;Maybe&mdash;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; He jumped at the sound. &nbsp;It was Gerda from the other end of
            the bar, nearest the stage. &nbsp;When he looked at her, she was waving at him. &nbsp;Pointing to the stage,
            she said, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s boring in here today. &nbsp;We need some excitement. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re a
            musician, why don&rsquo;t you come entertain us?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott&rsquo;s heart jumped. &nbsp;And suddenly he knew. &nbsp;This was it.
            &nbsp;This was why he was here. &nbsp;He looked around at the people in the bar. &nbsp;Still just three
            customers. &nbsp;If his music and his performance were somehow of great importance&hellip; Elliott frowned
            as he looked at the people. &nbsp;Wouldn&rsquo;t there be a roomful of people? &nbsp;How was playing for
            four tired people important enough to place him here. &nbsp;Unless, he thought suddenly, his heart pounding,
            unless one of them was an agent! &nbsp;Or even knew an agent!</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott felt his heart surge as he stood up from the bar stool. &nbsp;But as he
            started to walk toward the stage, he realized his heart had only surged as far as his throat and lodged
            there, threatening to choke him. &nbsp;His palms suddenly sweaty, Elliott&rsquo;s steps slowed and his walk
            became more unsteady as he continued haltingly toward the stage. &nbsp;His ears began to roar. &nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">What&rsquo;s all this? he wondered as he tried to keep putting one foot in front of
            the other. &nbsp;He eyed the guitar and willed himself to keep walking toward it. &nbsp;His stomach began to
            cramp.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Worst case of stage fright ever, he thought, as he continued slowly toward the stage.
            &nbsp;An audience of four and I feel like I&rsquo;m walking up to the mike at like Madison Square Garden or
            something. &nbsp;Elliott continued to chastise himself as he moved forward by inches. &nbsp;Then suddenly it
            hit him.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had no idea what to sing.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott stopped. &nbsp;His face began to burn as he realized his mind was totally
            blank. &nbsp;Over the years he&rsquo;d written several songs, some of them even pretty good. &nbsp;Mostly
            bluesy numbers, easy jazz sound. &nbsp;Gentle ballads about loneliness, love, hope &ndash; depending on his
            latest life crisis. &nbsp;But right now, in this moment, he had no idea what to do. &nbsp;He couldn&rsquo;t
            think of a single one of his own songs. &nbsp;Not one.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gerda was smiling at him. &nbsp;&ldquo;So?&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s
            hear what you got.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott stared at her. &nbsp;Opened his mouth to speak. &nbsp;Had no idea what to
            say. &nbsp;Clamped his mouth shut again.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Gerda tipped her head, still grinning. &nbsp;&ldquo;C&rsquo;mon!&rdquo; she
            encouraged. &nbsp;&ldquo;We promise not to throw tomatoes!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly, Elliott knew he was going to be sick. &nbsp;He turned and ran back the
            length of the bar to the restrooms. &nbsp;Crashing into the stall, he made it just in time. &nbsp; He stood
            over the toilet, coughing and choking, tears burning his eyes, his humiliation and frustration complete.
            &nbsp;A few moments later, leaning over the sink, splashing cool water on his face, Elliott barely had the
            strength to stand. &nbsp;He looked up at himself in the mirror over the sink. &nbsp;His image was distorted
            by the smudged and dirty mirror. &nbsp;Elliott turned his head slowly back and forth, watching his face warp
            and alter. &nbsp;He frowned. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I wasn&rsquo;t ready, he thought. &nbsp;He realized he was praying. &nbsp;You gave me
            a chance and I wasn&rsquo;t ready. &nbsp;Maybe I can get another cha&mdash;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott had stopped turning his head. &nbsp;Now his eyebrows furrowing when he
            realized his image was continuing to change. &nbsp;He began to feel light-headed. &nbsp;He flexed his hands.
            &nbsp;They felt like they were going to sleep, all tingly and &ndash;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott looked up suddenly at himself in the mirror.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Uh oh.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal was back in the wingback chair, staring again at the end of the couch where
            Elliott had been before he&rsquo;d disappeared hours ago. &nbsp;The three of them had made a frantic search
            in and around the house for the boy, all to no avail. &nbsp;They had discussed for some time why he would
            have been &ldquo;taken&rdquo; and to where, until finally giving up in total frustration. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I am sick to death,&rdquo; Candace had stated, &ldquo;of asking questions with
            no answers.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, they had each just gone their own way for awhile &ndash; the ladies to their
            rooms, Hal to the porch. &nbsp;After just a few minutes, Ariadne joined him silently on the porch.
            &nbsp;Less than an hour later, Candace joined them as well, glancing guiltily at them as she positioned
            herself in a wicker rocker. &nbsp;She was wearing a pair of jeans and loose-fitting purple sweater
            she&rsquo;d found in the closet in her room.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal spoke for all of them: &nbsp;&ldquo;Hard not to kind of keep an eye on each
            other.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The ladies nodded.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you think we&rsquo;ll. . . go away, too?&rdquo; &nbsp;It was
            Ariadne.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The newest unanswerable question just hung in the air as they watched the sun slowly
            setting.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">As darkness descended, Candace said, &ldquo;Well, at least we know time passes
            here.&rdquo; &nbsp;She stood, stretching slightly. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m getting hungry.
            &nbsp;Supper?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without answering, the other two stood and followed her into the house.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Supper finished, the three migrated back into the living room. &nbsp;Hal sat staring
            at the empty end of the couch. &nbsp;Candace was looking at one of the books she&rsquo;d found on the shelf.
            &nbsp;Ariadne had carried down the basket of yarn and, having sorted through the various colors, was
            creating the first line of chain stitches for a crochet project. &nbsp;Hal had put on a cd of light
            classical music. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t know as much about music as he would like to, but he knew what he
            liked. &nbsp;When he was in a contemplative mood, Bach was his favorite. &nbsp;When he was on his way to
            work, he liked Mozart or even Rachmaninoff. &nbsp;On the way home, it was usually Beethoven, especially the
            sonatas. &nbsp;There was a lot he listened to that he didn&rsquo;t even know the composer. &nbsp;He just
            liked the sound and the way it made him feel.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal sighed and tipped his head back on the chair. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace looked up at him as she turned another page that she hadn&rsquo;t
            read.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne looked over, her hands automatically continuing the uncounted chain
            stitching.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then the three of them jumped, a tiny scream escaping Ariadne, when there was a
            sudden and loud pounding on the stairs. &nbsp;All three jumped up and turned to see Elliott practically
            jumping off the last step. &nbsp;He was frowning slightly, his face intense, as he ran into the room.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t ready!&rdquo; he all but shouted. &nbsp;He rushed past them
            into the kitchen.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The three stared at each other, each mouth open in shock. &nbsp;Ariadne had her hand
            to her mouth. &nbsp;Before any of them could move or say anything, Elliott came back out of the kitchen.
            &nbsp;He was carrying a cold bottle of water from the refrigerator. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t ready,&rdquo; he said again to his stunned audience.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;I was given a chance to perform and I wasn&rsquo;t ready.&rdquo; &nbsp;He jabbed his finger
            toward Hal. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all about being </span><span class="c4">prepared</span><span
            class="c0">,&rdquo; he said seriously. &nbsp;&ldquo;And I wasn&rsquo;t prepared. &nbsp;But that&rsquo;s not
            going to happen again!&rdquo; &nbsp;He began walking again, heading quickly toward the steps.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to get to work on the best song I&rsquo;ve ever written. &nbsp;And next time
            &ndash; and I&rsquo;m somehow sure there </span><span class="c4">will</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;be a next
            time &ndash; I&rsquo;ll be </span><span class="c4">ready</span><span class="c0">!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without another look at the three, Elliott pounded back up the stairs. &nbsp;They
            heard his door slam shut just a moment later.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace, Ariadne, and Hal slowly turned and looked at each other, their eyes wide,
            mouths still open.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Ariadne said simply, sitting unsteadily back down in the chair,
            bending to retrieve the long yarn chain that had fallen from her lap.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Hal said, his knees a bit shaky as he too sat back into his
            chair. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace dropped back onto the couch, the book still in her hands. &nbsp;As she
            crossed one leg over the other and reopened the book, she muttered matter-of-factly, &ldquo;And then there
            were four. &nbsp;Again.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c15" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c13">Chapter 5</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The next morning, when Ariadne walked down the stairs and into the living room, she
            found Elliott sitting on the couch, leaning over the guitar across his lap, and writing on a pad of paper
            which lay on the coffee table. &nbsp;He looked up as she entered the room. &nbsp;His eyes were red, dark
            circles under them, but he was smiling.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good morning!&rdquo; he said brightly.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elliott,&rdquo; she said as she slowly approached him, &ldquo;are you all
            right? &nbsp;Have you slept at all?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott shook his head. &nbsp;&ldquo;Nope. &nbsp;Not last night. &nbsp;Never know
            when I&rsquo;m going to poof out of here again and I meant it when I said I was going to be
            ready!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was speaking very quickly, his words like rapid machine-gun fire. &nbsp;Ariadne
            tipped her head and squinted her eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo; she repeated.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh sure!&rdquo; he said, using the end of his pencil to tap a coffee mug
            sitting next to him on the table. &nbsp;&ldquo;I made coffee! &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve never made coffee before, but
            I was getting tired so I thought it would be a good idea so I just sort of figured it out. &nbsp;I figured
            about one scoop per cup, doesn&rsquo;t that sound about right? &nbsp;Boy, that coffee is strong stuff!
            &nbsp;I put in a ton of sugar, but it worked really good! I&rsquo;ve not gotten sleepy since about two
            o&rsquo;clock this morning!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne&rsquo;s eyes had slowly widened as he talked. &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t envy him
            the crash he was going to have later when all that caffeine left his system. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And how is the song coming?&rdquo; she asked, pulling the fluffy robe
            she&rsquo;d found in her closet around her.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Great! &nbsp;Or pretty great anyway!&rdquo; Elliott&rsquo;s movements were
            jerky, his eyes unfocused. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve just started hitting a bit of a roadblock and thought
            maybe I needed to take a break but I just hate to, you know, since I sure don&rsquo;t know when I might, you
            know,&rdquo; he waved his hand in the air as if demonstrating the movement of smoke rolling up from a
            fire.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne smiled at him. &nbsp;Walking around the table to his side of the couch, she
            rubbed his shoulder. &nbsp;His muscles twitched under her touch. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Honey,&rdquo; she said gently, &ldquo;why don&rsquo;t you take just a little
            break and let me fix you some toast to soak up all that coffee you drank. &nbsp;Okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott looked up at her, but it was hard to tell if he was looking her directly in
            the eye. &nbsp;He nodded, frowning slightly, laid the pencil down on the table, and surprised Ariadne when
            he handed the guitar to her. &nbsp;Taking it by the neck, she walked to the wall of shelves and propped it
            gently up, taking care that it wouldn&rsquo;t accidently topple over.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; she said as she secured the guitar, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go make the
            &ndash;&ldquo; &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">When she turned to look at Elliott, he was already sound asleep, curled up on the
            couch like a baby.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; Ariadne breathed to herself. &nbsp;Shaking her head, she headed
            toward the kitchen to find breakfast for herself.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">A few minutes later she was joined by Candace who walked into the kitchen wearing a
            bright blue warm-up suit and tennis shoes. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I see our happy wanderer crashed on the couch last night,&rdquo; she
            said.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne smiled at her as she placed her toasted and buttered English muffin and mug
            of warm apple juice on the table. &nbsp;&ldquo;No, he spent the night on the couch, but he just now crashed.
            &nbsp;Poor thing was hopped up on more caffeine than I&rsquo;ve had in my entire life.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace shook her head and laughed as she headed for the coffee maker to prepare a
            fresh pot. &nbsp;As she poured out the little bit left in the decanter, she laughed even harder.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;This stuff is like tar!&rdquo; she exclaimed, pouring the thick brew into the sink.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;How much coffee did he use?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne sipped her apple juice. &nbsp;&ldquo;One scoop per cup,&rdquo; she answered.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Is that too much?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace&rsquo;s eyebrows shot up and she looked over at Ariadne, the pot still in her
            hand, hanging over the sink.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is that too much? &nbsp;I like my coffee strong and I use one scant scoop for
            two to three cups.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne grinned. &nbsp;&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; she said simply.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">A minute later, the pot happily percolating, Candace grabbed a banana from a fruit
            bowl on the counter, and sat across from Ariadne. &nbsp;Popping the stem to begin peeling the banana, she
            frowned over at the other woman&rsquo;s cup.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that you&rsquo;re drinking?&rdquo; she asked.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Apple juice.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hot?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mm,&rdquo; Ariadne nodded as she took another sip.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace just stared at her.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Ariadne finally asked.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hot apple juice.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne nodded and took another sip. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, it&rsquo;s quite good.
            &nbsp;Would you like some?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Heavens no. &nbsp;Why, if I may ask, would you drink hot apple
            juice?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne put the cup down and looked at Candace. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a very tasty
            and satisfying &ndash; and healthy &ndash; alternative for coffee. &nbsp;Hot and stimulating, but no
            caffeine.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace hadn&rsquo;t moved or changed expression. &nbsp;&ldquo;Why not just
            decaf?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Ariadne met her gaze. &nbsp;&ldquo;Because there is no dietary or health
            benefit whatsoever to decaffeinated coffee. &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s not one hundred percent caffeine-free.
            &nbsp;The apple juice has natural sugar as a morning stimulant, but no artificial ingredients or
            additives.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two stared at each other for another moment across the table. &nbsp;Ariadne found
            herself wondering how long it would last and was grateful when Hal walked into the kitchen, causing them
            both to look over at him. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Morning,&rdquo; he said, frowning at the still-perking coffee pot.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s with sleeping beauty on the couch?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne told them both about her encounter with Elliott. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace peeled the banana halfway down and took a small bite. &nbsp;&ldquo;So
            what&rsquo;s your take on his idea about being prepared with a song?&rdquo; she asked Hal.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal leaned back in the chair, crossed his arms over his chest. &nbsp;Frowning, he
            said, &ldquo;I have no idea. &nbsp;But he knows what he felt, and I&rsquo;m not sure I have any right to
            dispute that.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How does he </span><span class="c4">know</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;that was
            why he was &lsquo;sent&rsquo; there?&rdquo; Candace asked, sounding like a reporter.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal frowned at her. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said, realizing how
            very tired he was of giving that answer. &nbsp;&ldquo;But he was pretty sure. &nbsp;I suppose he felt like
            he&rsquo;d gotten a word from God.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace&rsquo;s eyes widened. &nbsp;Her expression was a mix of humor and skepticism.
            &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Ariadne asked her. &nbsp;&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think he could
            have gotten a word from God?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace shrugged, an amused expression on her face. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I
            suppose&hellip;.,&rdquo; she said.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you a Christian?&rdquo; Ariadne asked, leaning forward and
            putting her elbows on the table.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Candace said, frowning now and leaning back in the chair.
            &nbsp;Her toes on the floor, she began to bounce her right heal, her leg jumping. &nbsp;&ldquo;So what are
            you saying?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne&rsquo;s gaze was even. &nbsp;&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t think a Christian
            would question someone hearing from God, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace looked offended, sputtered for a moment, but made no comment. &nbsp;After a
            pause, Hal said, his voice gentle. &nbsp;&ldquo;Candace, have you ever heard from God?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">At first she looked defiant, her face growing red. &nbsp;But gradually, the anger
            left her eyes and she looked more sad, perhaps even a little defeated.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I thought so. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve only been a
            Christian for three years. &nbsp;I&rsquo;d been working as a radio journalist, then some smaller television
            stations in Michigan where I&rsquo;d gone to school. I was getting really frustrated at the thought that I
            was approaching thirty and getting nowhere in this business, which is, by the way, </span><span
            class="c4">highly</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;competitive.&rdquo; &nbsp;Hal and Ariadne nodded.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Then a friend invited me to a big church rally thing and I got&hellip; well,
            &lsquo;saved&rsquo; I guess. &nbsp;After that, my friend told me to trust God with my career decisions
            &ndash; to let Him decide for me. &nbsp;So I asked Him what to do. &nbsp;I was absolutely certain He told me
            to pull up stakes, move to DFW, and that He&rsquo;d make me a success in the field.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She pushed away from the table, walked over to the coffeepot and poured two mugs of
            coffee. &nbsp;Walking back to the table, she sat back down, pushing one mug across the table at Hal.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he said, picking it up.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace nodded. &nbsp;She blew into the cup, steam flowing off the hot coffee and
            wafting up into the air. &nbsp;Candace frowned into the cup. &nbsp;Hal and Ariadne waited quietly.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So here I am. &nbsp;It took a whole year before I even found a job. &nbsp;I
            worked as a waitress and a cosmetic counter saleswoman before I got the job at KKTV. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s not a
            major station. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve been there two years and still report on tree cutting and road closures and
            school board meetings. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m thirty-one. &nbsp;My chances of getting an anchor position are
            swiftly declining with each year.&rdquo; &nbsp;She stopped, chuckling and waving her hand, gesturing to the
            room around her. &nbsp;&ldquo;And now!&rdquo; she said, her voice rising, &ldquo;Now I don&rsquo;t know
        </span><span class="c4">what</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;is happening!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She took a large swallow of coffee, wincing as the hot liquid burned her throat.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;So my one shot at hearing from God was not so successful. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t try that
            anymore.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was silence for several moments, interrupted only by the sipping of hot drinks.
            &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Candace?&rdquo; It was Ariadne. &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you believe Jesus died for
            you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace looked defeated when she looked over at Ariadne. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she
            sighed, nodding. &nbsp;&ldquo;I do.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And you recognize that that is your only way into heaven? &nbsp;By believing
            on Him and accepting that gift?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace sighed again. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she repeated, nodding again.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne looked over at Hal.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well then,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are certainly
            &lsquo;saved.&rsquo;&rdquo; He accented the word as she had. &nbsp;Sighing himself, he leaned forward,
            sliding his forearms onto the tabletop. &nbsp;&ldquo;Sometimes,&rdquo; he said, knowing he sounded like a
            father, &ldquo;sometimes it just takes awhile for things to &lsquo;kick in,&rsquo; you know? &nbsp;I mean,
            it&rsquo;s quite possible God </span><span class="c4">did</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;tell you to come to
            the Dallas, Ft. Worth area, and he </span><span class="c4">did</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;give you the job
            at your station. &nbsp;I mean, we can&rsquo;t see the whole plan all the time, you know?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal frowned and sighed. &nbsp;He was doing this all wrong. &nbsp;&ldquo;You
            remember,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;those pictures we used to look at in magazines as kids? &nbsp;They were
            close-up shots of an ordinary item, magnified hundreds of times, and we were supposed to figure out what
            they were?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne&rsquo;s face lit up. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes! &nbsp;I remember those! &nbsp;I hardly
            ever got them right, but was so fascinated with the pictures!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal nodded, looked back at Candace who was eying him almost suspiciously.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;That little section or orange or whatever,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;doesn&rsquo;t look like much
            of anything when you&rsquo;re that close to it. &nbsp;You can&rsquo;t even tell what it is for sure.
            &nbsp;But then they showed you a picture of the same item from a ways off and suddenly it made sense.
            &nbsp;It was a slice of orange and it was clear as a bell.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace raised one eyebrow. &nbsp;Hal cleared his throat and tried to get to the
            point. &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s like us and God,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re here right up
            close to the bit of orange and can&rsquo;t hardly tell what it is. &nbsp;But God is back where it&rsquo;s
            clear and makes sense &ndash; He can see the whole picture. &nbsp;So we just ask Him and trust that even
            though it doesn&rsquo;t look like much here, He can see it all and as long as we follow His voice, it will
            all. . . well. . . work out. &nbsp;Make sense. &nbsp;You know?&rdquo; &nbsp;Hal finished weakly, glancing at
            Ariadne who smiled encouragingly.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a long silence during which Candace kept a steady gaze on Hal, she finally
            said, &ldquo;So God told me to come to Dallas so I would get blown out of a store during a tornado and land
            in some mystery place with three strangers and no apparent way of getting back to actually complete
            anything.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal&rsquo;s face reddened and he glanced again at Ariadne.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne straightened her petite frame and looked directly at Candace across the table
            from her. &nbsp;&ldquo;How sure were you that God was speaking to you back then?&rdquo; she asked, her voice
            firmer than they had ever heard it. &nbsp;&ldquo;Be honest. &nbsp;Think hard. &nbsp;How sure were
            you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace looked surprised at first, then thoughtful. &nbsp;Finally she said, &ldquo;I
            was very sure. &nbsp;Since then, I&rsquo;ve just figured it was the emotional high I was on following that
            church experience.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Never mind that,&rdquo; Ariadne said, waving her hand.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s stick to facts. &nbsp;You accepted Christ, you heard from God, you acted on what
            you heard. &nbsp;That is </span><span class="c4">all</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;you need to know.
            &nbsp;You may </span><span class="c4">never</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;know why He directed you the way He
            did. &nbsp;But our job is simply to ask, then obey. &nbsp;You did that. &nbsp;I suggest you open your ears
            back up. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s likely not done directing you yet.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace looked surprised at Ariadne&rsquo;s words, or at least her tone, then frowned
            again and fidgeted in the seat.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo; Hal asked.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been sitting too long,&rdquo; she mumbled. &nbsp;&ldquo;My leg is
            going to sleep.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Uh oh!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">They all turned to see Elliott in the doorway, his hair and clothes disheveled, his
            eyes barely focused. &nbsp;He was weaving a bit on his feet.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo; Hal said.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott pointed at Candace. &nbsp;When they turned to look at her, she was rubbing
            her arms and looking frightened. She was also appearing to fade before their eyes. &nbsp;As Elliott had.
            &nbsp; &ldquo;I feel &ndash;&ldquo; she began.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Be prepared!&rdquo; Elliott yelled as Candace quickly faded from view and
            disappeared.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>

    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c15" id="h.tyjcwt"><span class="c13">Chapter 6</span></p>
    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was sitting in a car, in the driver&rsquo;s seat.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Well, Candace thought, at least it&rsquo;s not moving.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Looking around, it appeared she was out in the country somewhere. &nbsp;The road was
            barely two lanes, paved a long time ago as evidenced by the potholes and eroded edges. &nbsp;There were no
            buildings in sight, just fields and the scrub trees that lined the road. &nbsp;Candace sighed with relief
            when she saw the keys were in the ignition. &nbsp;Doesn&rsquo;t matter where I am, she thought, I can find
            my way back to the city.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She turned the key and was rewarded with nothing but a clicking sound. Frowning, she
            turned it again. &nbsp;Pumped the gas and turned it again. &nbsp;Pounded the steering wheel and turned it
            again. &nbsp;Only clicks each time.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace dropped her head down on the steering wheel. &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t know
            whether to laugh or cry. &nbsp;But she hadn&rsquo;t cried in a very long time. &nbsp;She settled for a
            derisive laugh and pounded the steering wheel one more time for good measure. &nbsp;She was reaching for the
            handle of the door to get out when she heard a noise. &nbsp;Looking up into the rearview mirror, she saw an
            old pickup truck pulling up behind her. &nbsp;A tall, very thin young man unfolded from the driver&rsquo;s
            seat and started toward her door. &nbsp;Instinct borne of independence and city living told her to flee, but
            there was nowhere to go. &nbsp;Sighing, Candace cranked down the window as the man reached the side of the
            car.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;He was very young, probably a teenager. &nbsp;He
            was wearing worn, but not fashionably worn, jeans and a faded blue t-shirt. &nbsp;His expression was
            pleasant, but tired as he brushed his unruly black hair out of his eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;You need
            help?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace sucked in her lower lip. &nbsp;If he could get the car working, she could get
            to the city and the station. &nbsp;Did she have a story to tell them&hellip;.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she finally said. &nbsp;&ldquo;My, um, car doesn&rsquo;t seem to
            want to start.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boy frowned and nodded. &nbsp;&ldquo;You mind trying it so I can
            hear?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace turned the key and heard the now-familiar click.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boy nodded again, his face serious. &nbsp;&ldquo;You mind popping the hood?
            &nbsp;Might be your battery is dead.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Grateful that the boy was heading back to his car and therefore didn&rsquo;t see her
            fumbling around in the unfamiliar car for a hood release, Candace finally found it and pulled, the hood
            popping up a few inches. &nbsp;She looked in the rearview mirror to see the boy starting his truck and
            pulling forward, turning toward the side of the road. &nbsp;His front tires dropped off the broken pavement,
            and she could hear him gunning his engine to pull them back up when he went into reverse. &nbsp;Soon he had
            his truck in front of and facing her, its hood up also. &nbsp;Candace stepped out of the car as he walked
            over and easily lifted the hood of her car. &nbsp;Leaning in, he did a quick check, then walked back to his
            truck, pulling jumper cables from behind the driver&rsquo;s seat. &nbsp;Deftly hooking them up on each
            vehicle, he looked up at her and nodded.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace smiled.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You mind trying to start it now?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Embarrassed, Candace exclaimed, &ldquo;Oh! Of course!&rdquo; and sat back down in the
            car. &nbsp;Crossing her fingers, she turned the key in the ignition, pressing down on the gas pedal for
            added luck. &nbsp;Nothing.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay!&rdquo; she heard the boy call, and she turned off the key.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not the battery,&rdquo; he said as she stepped around the front of the car
            again. &nbsp;&ldquo;Probably your starter motor. &nbsp;Maybe the alternator.&rdquo; &nbsp;He stood and
            frowned up at the sky, brushing his hair back again. &nbsp;&ldquo;Going to storm soon.&rdquo; &nbsp;He
            looked over at Candace who was peering up at the gathering storm clouds.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is there someone you can call?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What day is this?&rdquo; she asked.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Day,&rdquo; she said simply, probably too harshly. &nbsp;&ldquo;What day is
            this?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, it&rsquo;s Thursday.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace&rsquo;s face registered shock. &nbsp;&ldquo;Thursday? What&rsquo;s the
            date?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He told her. &nbsp;It was the day of the storm.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ma&rsquo;am, is there someone you can--?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Candace practically barked. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve lost my cell
            phone. &nbsp;Can I use yours?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boy just looked at her. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a cell
            phone.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is there a phone at your house? &nbsp;Can you drive me into town? &nbsp;Where
            are we, exactly?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boy&rsquo;s expression was becoming more suspicious by the question. &nbsp;He
            blinked slowly and frowned at her, stretching up to his full height, which was several inches past six feet,
            she was sure. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How exactly did you get out here, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo; he asked.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Not too many folks just accidently end up in these parts.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Long story,&rdquo; Candace said dismissively, looking around them. &nbsp;There
            was </span><span class="c4">nothing</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to be seen. &nbsp;&ldquo;How far are we
            from the city?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boy cocked his head at her. &nbsp;His eyes seemed very tired and still
            suspicious, but now also slightly amused. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well now, if you mean Clawson, we&rsquo;re not but
            about five miles from there. &nbsp;But if you mean a big city, the closest one is Dallas and that&rsquo;s
            about an hour and a half away.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And no,&rdquo; he added before she could say more, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t drive
            you into either because I have to get home. &nbsp;And no, there&rsquo;s no phone there either. &nbsp;But if
            you let me tow your car I can try to fix it and get you on your way. . . to wherever you were going.&rdquo;
        </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace sucked in her lower lip again and narrowed her eyes at the boy whose
            expression didn&rsquo;t change. &nbsp;Reluctantly accepting the fact that she didn&rsquo;t have much of a
            choice, Candace nodded and waved her hand at the car in a gesture of acceptance. &nbsp;The boy stood for
            just a moment more looking at her, then turned to his truck. &nbsp;When he came back, he was carrying a
            heavy chain. &nbsp;He stopped in front of her car, the chain draping over his hands. &nbsp;Candace noticed
            his hands were stained almost black.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This may not be very good for your bumper,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace shrugged and gestured again, giving him the go-ahead.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Twenty minutes later, she was sitting in the cab of his pickup, her arms crossed, the
            bouncing of her legs having more to do with nerves than with the condition of the road. &nbsp;Within a few
            minutes, she could see a large farmhouse ahead. &nbsp;It somewhat resembled the yellow house from wherever
            it was she had come from, only a little larger, a lot older, and in bad need of a paint job.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boy pulled to a very slow stop in front of the house. &nbsp;Just as he stopped
            the truck, the door to the house opened and a young woman, girl really, stepped out onto the porch, a
            toddler in her left arm straddling her hip. &nbsp;She looked worried. &nbsp;When Candace dropped out of the
            truck and walked around the front of it, the girl was talking quickly as the boy undid the chain attaching
            the car to his truck.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;. . . late, Jeremy, if I don&rsquo;t leave in the next two minutes.
            &nbsp;Who&rsquo;s this?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace looked up and realized the girl was talking about her. &nbsp;The boy, Jeremy,
            looked up from the chain at Candace and frowned. &nbsp;&ldquo;Um&hellip;.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Candace Richards,&rdquo; she said, just stopping herself from adding,
            &ldquo;KKTV news.&rdquo; &nbsp;&ldquo;Your, um,&rdquo; she suddenly realized she had no idea what the
            relationship was, &ldquo;Jeremy here just rescued me and my dead car from the road.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The girl didn&rsquo;t frown exactly, but neither did she smile. &nbsp;Looking briefly
            at Jeremy who began busying himself with the chain again, she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m Penny, Jeremy&rsquo;s
            sister. Jeremy, will I still be able to take the truck?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy was pulling the chain from around the bumper of the car. &nbsp;Nodding, he
            said, &ldquo;Of course. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll fix her car and she&rsquo;ll be on her way. &nbsp;She doesn&rsquo;t
            have a phone to call for help.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Penny looked concerned. &nbsp;&ldquo;But what about--?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy was already lifting a hand. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll take care of them.
            &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t worry. &nbsp;Just go to work.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Penny frowned, looking from her brother to Candace. &nbsp;Finally, she sighed,
            shifted the toddler in her arms, and said, &ldquo;Okay. &nbsp;Mandy didn&rsquo;t sleep well again last
            night, so she&rsquo;ll be cranky. &nbsp;Richie is eating breakfast. &nbsp;Joy has already eaten and is
            getting dressed. &nbsp;It looks like rain, so make sure they take their slickers.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy nodded, reaching into the bed of the truck to retrieve what looked to Candace
            like an old tin lunchbox. &nbsp;Putting that on the ground, he reached in and pushed another, very large,
            metal box to the end of the truck&rsquo;s bed. &nbsp;Dropping the back, he lifted the big box out and,
            walking obviously with effort, set it on the porch. &nbsp;Reaching up, he took the toddler, Mandy, Candace
            supposed, from Penny, then walked back to the truck to put the tailgate up. &nbsp;Penny was already climbing
            into the cab of the truck. &nbsp;Jeremy walked over and leaned in so Penny could kiss Mandy. &nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Be good,&rdquo; she said, cupping the child&rsquo;s chin briefly and smiling
            at her. &nbsp;Looking up at Jeremy, she said, &ldquo;See you at five.&rdquo; &nbsp;With a brief, almost
            suspicious, glance at Candace, she pulled the truck door closed, started it up, and pulled forward, circling
            around to pull back out the way they had come in.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy stood watching her for a moment. &nbsp;Candace was sure she heard him sigh.
            &nbsp;Then he smiled at Mandy, bouncing her slightly in his arms.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mandypoo!&rdquo; he said playfully, causing the little girl to giggle.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s go check on the beatniks.&rdquo; &nbsp;Smiling slightly at Candace, he tipped his
            head slightly, encouraging her to follow him into the house. &nbsp;Raising her eyebrows and looking quickly
            around, Candace followed, wondering not what she had gotten herself into, but rather what she had just been
            thrust into.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The inside of the house was just as old looking, just as in need of paint, but
            Candace was surprised by the neatness of it. &nbsp;The furniture was aged, most covered with towels, or old
            sheets or blankets, but they were all neatly covered, the edges and corners crisp. &nbsp;There were some old
            photos on the walls and a couple vintage landscape pictures, but most of the wall art were children&rsquo;s
            drawings of various stages of maturity &ndash; from blob-looking fingerpaintings to a group stick-people
            portrait to a fairly detailed watercolor of the house she was in with five people on the porch or playing in
            the yard. &nbsp;The pictures lit up the otherwise almost colorless room. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy walked to the stairs at the back of the room and called up, &ldquo;Joy!
            &nbsp;Bus in fifteen! You ready?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace heard a small female voice call back, &ldquo;Yep! Coming!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy, who hadn&rsquo;t stopped, continued walking to the left, through a large
            arched doorway, into the kitchen. &nbsp;Candace followed, more out of curiosity than anything. &nbsp;A young
            boy of no more than eleven, was sitting at the table, hunched over a bowl of half-eaten cereal. &nbsp;He was
            a miniature version of Jeremy and only glanced briefly up at him as he walked into the room. &nbsp;Walking
            over to the refrigerator, Jeremy pulled out a container of orange juice and took it to the counter.
            &nbsp;Still balancing Mandy in his arm, he adroitly pulled a glass and a plastic kids&rsquo; cup out of the
            cupboard, filled them both with juice, popped a lid on the kids cup, then handed it to Mandy who immediately
            started drinking. &nbsp;Jeremy sat her down and she ambled off back toward the living room, glancing up
            shyly at Candace as she passed her.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy sat down at the table with his glass of juice and looked at the boy.
            &nbsp;Candace felt like an invisible spy as she watched the two who had not yet spoken to each other.
            &nbsp;When they did start speaking, the tones were so low, she found herself actually leaning in to hear
            them.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How you doing?&rdquo; Jeremy said.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boy didn&rsquo;t look up, but nodded, put another spoonful of cereal into his
            mouth, chewed slowly. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You get your math homework done?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another nod.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Spell government for me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;G-o-v-e-r-n-m-e-n-t.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Excellent. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll ace that test today.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boy&rsquo;s face flushed almost imperceptively.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace didn&rsquo;t realize the boy had spoken again until Jeremy answered.
            &nbsp;Glancing back at Candace, he said to the boy. &nbsp;&ldquo;Her name is Ms. Richards. &nbsp;Ms.
            Richards, this is my brother, Richard. &nbsp;Richie.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Candace, please,&rdquo; Candace said. &nbsp;Neither of them looked at her.
            &nbsp;Jeremy was continuing to talk to his brother in a low voice.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Her car broke down and she didn&rsquo;t have a phone to call anyone, so
            I&rsquo;m going to fix her car. &nbsp;I wish it was Saturday and you could help me. &nbsp;Not sure how I can
            do it without your help.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The almost-not-there blush returned.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just then, there was a noise behind Candace and a little girl of about seven or eight
            came skipping into the room. &nbsp;Never comfortable with or even all that interested in children, even
            Candace could see that this little girl was exceptionally beautiful. &nbsp;She had long, curling brown hair,
            captured into a pink frilly hair tie. &nbsp;She was wearing jeans that were a little too short, and a pink
            spaghetti strap top with a faded face of one of the famous cartoon princesses on the front. &nbsp;Her tiny
            toes peeking out through a pair of worn sandals had been painted pink some time ago. &nbsp;And when she
            looked up at Candace, the reporter thought her heart would stop. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The little girl&rsquo;s eyes were a vivid blue. &nbsp;They almost looked like faceted
            jewels in her creamy face, sweetly rounded, her cheeks boasting a natural blush. &nbsp;And, unlike the rest
            of her family, she was smiling and appeared thrilled to see Candace. &nbsp;Candace found herself thinking
            that if she hadn&rsquo;t been born with the name &ldquo;Joy,&rdquo; she could certainly see why she was
            called that now.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hi!&rdquo; the little girl said, looking brightly up at her. &nbsp;&ldquo;My
            name is Joy! Who are you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Glancing briefly at Jeremy who seemed barely to notice, Candace smiled down at the
            girl. &nbsp;&ldquo;My name is Candace,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Nice to meet you.&rdquo; &nbsp;She
            found herself holding out her hand.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The little girl looked delighted and took it in a surprisingly firm handshake.
            &nbsp;Giggling, she said, &ldquo;Are you going to stay here?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh no,&rdquo; Candace said, surprised at how much she herself was smiling.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m just visiting. &nbsp;Jeremy is going to fix my car.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Joy looked over at her big brother with obvious pride. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s
            good at that! &nbsp;Jer-jer can fix anything. &nbsp;He fixed my schoolbag, and my swing, and he even built
            me a dollhouse. &nbsp;You wanna see it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy was standing now from the table, running his hand over Richie&rsquo;s head,
            smoothing a cowlick threatening to pop up. &nbsp;&ldquo;No, Joy, sorry. &nbsp;School bus is on the way.
            &nbsp;You have your bag?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Joy spun around so Jeremy could see it laying against her back. &nbsp;Turning to
            Richie, Jeremy said, &ldquo;You have your stuff, champ?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Richie was standing from the table. &nbsp;Reaching into a near-by chair, he pulled up
            a bookbag. &nbsp;Without a word, he walked past them toward the door. &nbsp;Jeremy bent and swooped Joy up
            into his arms, the little girl squealing with delight. &nbsp;Kissing her neck, his day&rsquo;s growth of
            beard tickling her, he spun her around once, then set her on the floor. &nbsp;Still giggling, she ran toward
            the door. &nbsp;Jeremy scooped the toddler Mandy up as he followed the other two to the door. &nbsp;As they
            all stepped out onto the porch, Candace could hear something and looked up to see a school bus approaching
            the house. &nbsp;It pulled into the yard, swinging right and making a circle, stopping in front of the
            house, the doors making a whooshing sound as they opened to receive the two children. &nbsp;Richie stepped
            on without a glance back. &nbsp;Joy turned on the step and waved enthusiastically. &nbsp;Jeremy waved back
            and Candace was surprised to find her own hand in the air, waving at the girl. &nbsp;The bus door closed and
            the bus continued on its loop and back out onto the road.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy stood for a moment watching it go. &nbsp;Candace was sure she heard him sigh
            again. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Looking over at Candace, he said, &ldquo;I promise I&rsquo;ll get right to your car.
            &nbsp;I&rsquo;m sorry about the delay. &nbsp;But before I can do anything else, I&rsquo;ve got at least
            three story books and a good round of bucking bronco I need to take care of. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s tea bags or
            juice in the kitchen. &nbsp;And help yourself to any other breakfast you can find.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace watched as Jeremy put Mandy down on the porch, tickling her briefly.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Where&rsquo;s today&rsquo;s story?&rdquo; he asked her. &nbsp;Her little face lit up and, still
            clutching her juice cup, she took off into the house, her big brother right on her heals.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace looked around again, her eyes settling on the dead car in the yard, then
            lifting to the darkening sky.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Oddly, she found herself thinking as she headed back into the house, He forgot their
            slickers.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>

    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Elliott&rsquo;s door was open, so
            Hal, hearing the quiet sounds of guitar, stopped in the doorway, leaning against the doorframe.
            &nbsp;Elliott was sitting in a chair facing the window, strumming lightly. &nbsp;Hal thought he heard quiet
            singing. &nbsp;Interloper guilt warming his face, Hal shifted slightly and softly cleared his throat.
            &nbsp;Elliott looked around and smiled. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; he said, tipping his head in invitation. &nbsp;&ldquo;Come on
            in.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal grinned and stepped into the room, looking appreciatively at the instruments and
            equipment. &nbsp;&ldquo;You have a real guitar in here?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott&rsquo;s eyebrows went up. &nbsp;&ldquo;A &lsquo;real&rsquo;
            guitar?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; Hal said, continuing to look around. &nbsp;Spotting what he was
            looking for, he walked over to the acoustic guitar leaning against its stand. &nbsp;He gestured toward it
            and raised his eyebrows questioningly at Elliott who nodded permission. &nbsp;Picking up the guitar, Hal
            said, &ldquo;Right! &nbsp;A real guitar &ndash; no knobs, plugs, or wires.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; Elliott said, standing slightly and using his foot to move his
            chair so it faced the room. &nbsp;Sitting again so he was facing Hal who was positioning himself on the
            futon, he said, &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re the anti-techi.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal nodded thoughtfully. &nbsp;&ldquo;I suppose I am.&rdquo; &nbsp;He began quietly
            strumming the guitar, his ear tipped down toward the neck of the guitar, listening for proper tuning.
            &nbsp;It was perfect.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott, too, was still strumming the electric guitar in his arms, automatically
            shifting to Hal&rsquo;s key of G strumming. &nbsp;Soon the two were in synch, Hal strumming the chords and
            Elliott picking out a random tune. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without stopping, Elliott eventually said, &ldquo;So what is it you do &ndash; did
            &ndash; for a living?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Humor in his eyes, Hal looked to his right at Elliott. &nbsp;&ldquo;I was a computer
            tech support director for a school district.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott&rsquo;s fingers froze over the guitar strings. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry
            &ndash; what?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal chuckled and nodded, continuing to strum the guitar, shifting to a new key which
            Elliott easily and quickly began to play in also. &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott&rsquo;s head tipped, amusement brightening his eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;So,&rdquo;
            he said, dragging out the word, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a story there?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal chuckled again. &nbsp;&ldquo;I live and work in the world of technology,&rdquo;
            he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I watch kids with ear buds almost permanently in place, texting continuously, while
            watching television or playing video games. &nbsp;Yet with all that input, if I speak to them they
            can&rsquo;t utter a decent &lsquo;how do you do&rsquo;. &nbsp;I spent a day at one of the high schools in my
            district installing new equipment and do you know not one student made eye contact with me? &nbsp;Not
            one.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He strummed a few moments in silence. &nbsp;&ldquo;I just don&rsquo;t think all the
            technology is helping us as a society, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott continued to pick out a tune in Hal&rsquo;s chosen key.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said, drawing it out this time as well, &ldquo;must be a pretty frustrating
            job&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal nodded, his brow knitting as he changed the rhythm of his strumming.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Very. &nbsp;Just not much else I can do. &nbsp;And I have a wife and two kids&hellip;. &ldquo;
            &nbsp;Hal&rsquo;s face reddened and Elliott looked down at his guitar, allowing the man his moment.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you two hungry?&rdquo; &nbsp;It was Ariadne at the door.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Neither man stopped playing, but Hal slid down to the end of the futon closest to
            Elliott and nodded toward the other end. &nbsp;&ldquo;Come join us,&rdquo; he said.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne smiled a small, grateful smile, and sat gently on the end of the futon.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know you played, too,&rdquo; she said to Hal.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Grinning, he said, &ldquo;Not much and not well.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two musicians continued their impromptu session, Ariadne looking almost wistfully
            out the window.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;s coming back?&rdquo; Before the question left her
            lips, she had thought she was going to say, &ldquo;Do you think she&rsquo;s okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal looked up. &nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been gone quite a while.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been gone a lot longer than me, huh?&rdquo; Elliott said.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne frowned slightly. &nbsp;&ldquo;No, you&rsquo;d come back by now, but
            it&rsquo;s not that much longer. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s really hard to gauge time here, though.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott stopped playing the guitar and frowned at Ariadne, then looked also at Hal.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Seriously? &nbsp;I was gone this long?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal nodded. &nbsp;&ldquo;Pretty close, I&rsquo;d say.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott sat up, his face puzzled. &nbsp;&ldquo;No kidding. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s
            weird.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; Ariadne tipped her head at him.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, I didn&rsquo;t look at a clock or anything, but I told you everything
            that happened while I was there. &nbsp;I couldn&rsquo;t have been there an hour even. &nbsp;But it sure
            seems like a whole lot more time than that has gone by since Candace, um, left.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two on the futon looked at each other. &nbsp;&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; Hal
            agreed.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo; Elliott said, shaking his head as if to rid it of the idea.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;That whole time warp, time travel thing really messes with my head. &nbsp;I love science
            fiction, but that stuff&rsquo;ll get to me. &nbsp;Throw in the whole alternate universe thing like we have
            here and I&rsquo;m scratching my head and jumping at noises for a week.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal chuckled and leaned back on the futon, the guitar resting across his legs.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; he agreed. &nbsp;&ldquo;It was a short time there, but longer
            here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Or so it seemed,&rdquo; Ariadne corrected.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Or so it seemed,&rdquo; he allowed. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And where,&rdquo; Elliott chimed in, his eyes wide and a finger up in the air,
            &ldquo;was &lsquo;there&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal stifled a laugh. &nbsp;&ldquo;Meaning?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott looked surprised at Hal&rsquo;s confusion. &nbsp;&ldquo;Where was I?
            &nbsp;Was it the world we left? &nbsp;Was it an alternate world? &nbsp;Was it another place here in this
            &ndash; world, or whatever it is? &nbsp;Was I,&rdquo; he added, his excitement building and his voice
            getting louder, &ldquo;in an alternate reality? &nbsp;Or!&rdquo; he practically shouted, straightening up as
            a new idea apparently occurred to him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Or is </span><span class="c4">this</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;the alternate reality?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne, comfortable in loose-fitting jeans and an oversized sweater, crossed her
            legs up under her. &nbsp;Facing Hal and Elliott, her elbows on her knees, she said, &ldquo;I truly doubt
            we&rsquo;ll ever know the answers to any of those questions. &nbsp;Maybe what we should be thinking about is
        </span><span class="c4">why</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;&rsquo;Why?&rsquo;&rdquo; Elliott said, leaning forward slightly and wrapping
            his arms around the guitar. &nbsp;&ldquo;Why what?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why did you go there?&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Why that place? &nbsp;Why
            those people? &nbsp;Was there something you were supposed to do or learn?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott cocked his head again, frowning. &nbsp;&ldquo;I told you. &nbsp;I believe I
            was there to play a song and I didn&rsquo;t have one ready. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m hoping I&rsquo;ll get another
            chance. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;ve been working so hard &ndash; so I will be.
            &nbsp;Ready.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Ariadne said kindly, &ldquo;why, Elliott? &nbsp;I mean, this seems
            much bigger than a song, you know? &nbsp;Not that your music isn&rsquo;t important,&rdquo; she added
            quickly.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott looked thoughtful. &nbsp;Clearing his throat and looking suddenly very
            awkward, he said, not looking directly at either of them, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t been a Christian for very
            long. &nbsp;A buddy of mine gave me some cds to listen to. &nbsp;I loved the sound of one in particular and
            kept playing it. &nbsp;I was mostly listening for the sound. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve never been much of a lyrics
            guy. &nbsp;But on about the third playing, I began to hear the words, and then I couldn&rsquo;t </span><span
            class="c4">not</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;listen, you know what I mean? &nbsp;It was all about
            &lsquo;going to the cross,&rsquo; and &lsquo;what You did for me,&rsquo; and &lsquo;thank You for loving
            me.&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott turned slight in the chair and looked out the window. &nbsp;&ldquo;I
            didn&rsquo;t get it. &nbsp;But I listened, and then I started asking questions. &nbsp;That, of course, is
            just what my buddy was hoping I&rsquo;d do.&rdquo; &nbsp;Elliott chuckled lightly. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I read in the Bible that God is like everywhere, that He leaves his signature
            on all things in nature so that everyone can get to know Him. &nbsp;Well, it&rsquo;s music where I see Him
            best. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s I guess why the Psalms are my favorite part of the Bible. &nbsp;Somehow when music
            is involved -- when I&rsquo;m writing, or playing, or just listening to it -- He seems to be clearer to me.
            &nbsp;You know?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He turned and looked at Hal and Ariadne who were both nodding thoughtfully.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Elliott continued, &ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t surprise me that my
            whole. . . otherworldly encounter, or whatever. . . had something to do with music. &nbsp;I just
        </span><span class="c4">knew</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;when I was there that the reason for me being there
            was that chance to go to the stage and play.&rdquo; &nbsp;Elliott stopped, looked down at the guitar still
            in his hands. &nbsp;&ldquo;And then I blew it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne and Hal looked at each other. &nbsp;It was Ariadne who spoke first.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You did not blow it! &nbsp;I mean, what a strange situation! &nbsp;Give
            yourself a break, Elliott. &nbsp;Really.&rdquo; &nbsp;She twisted her mouth in frustration at her inability
            to think of anything more encouraging.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; Hal spoke up, sensing her frustration. &nbsp;&ldquo;Man, how
            could you have been ready for that? &nbsp;And look at you now! &nbsp;You&rsquo;re making preparations for
            the next time.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If there is a next time,&rdquo; Elliott added.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal frowned, then nodded in agreement. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, </span><span
            class="c4">if</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;there is a next time. &nbsp;But that&rsquo;s all you can do,
            El.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott nodded almost reluctantly. &nbsp;Hoisting the guitar up in front of him, he
            began again to strum at the strings. &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m going to be ready,&rdquo; he
            said. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be the best song I&rsquo;ve ever written.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne drew her knees up under her chin, wrapping her arms around her legs.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;I wonder what lesson Candace is learning,&rdquo; she said, her voice small.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace stared at Jeremy, still cradling the finally-sleeping Mandy in his arms.
            &nbsp;Penny called that one, Candace thought wryly. &nbsp;Mandy may not have slept well last night, but that
            child just took &lsquo;cranky&rsquo; to a whole new level. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The past hour had been a whirlwind of terror, in Candace&rsquo;s eyes. &nbsp;It
            started calmly enough with Jeremy reading a sweet little rhyming story picture book to his sister.
            &nbsp;Mandy&rsquo;s eyes had begun to droop and her head to loll back a bit on her big brother&rsquo;s
            shoulder. &nbsp;Apparently that portent to sleep was enough to send red alert signals through her toddler
            brain and she found an adrenaline source they didn&rsquo;t see coming. &nbsp;From that point, her only goal
            was to stay awake and her arch enemy was anyone who thought differently. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Story books were of no use after that. &nbsp;The bucking-bronco ride across the
            living room became alarmingly violent, proffered treats and sippy cups turned into missiles and the decibel
            level of her little girl screams caused a ringing in Candace&rsquo;s ears that lasted for thirty minutes
            after the last scream echoed through the house.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, Jeremy, with another frantic apologetic look at Candace, expertly wrapped
            his arms around the child, cradling her to him, but in such a way that she could barely move, sat on the
            couch, and sang &ldquo;Jesus Loves Me&rdquo; while rocking back and forth against the cushions almost
            violently at first, the song sounding like it was being barked through clenched teeth. &nbsp;Candace must
            have looked horrified at what appeared to be almost abuse, because Jeremy, Mandy still screaming in his
            arms, sang, as if they were previously unheard lyrics to the song:</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c11">&ldquo;This will help her go to sleep,</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c11">Will you hand me &lsquo;pacie&rsquo; please?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace, taking a second to realize what she had just heard, startled into action,
            bending to retrieve the previously-thrown pacifier from the floor.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you want me to go wash it off?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy, still singing, shook his head and opened his mouth. &nbsp;Candace raised her
            eyebrows. &nbsp;The sound coming out as a gargled hum now, he nodded again almost desperately.
            &nbsp;Finally, Candace put the pacifier in Jeremy&rsquo;s open mouth, continuing to stare dumbfounded at
            him. &nbsp;When he nodded again, still humming, Mandy still screaming, she didn&rsquo;t know what to do at
            first. &nbsp;Jeremy&rsquo;s humming took on a more frustrated tone and he looked pointedly, and cross-eyed,
            down at the pacifier. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Candace said, pulling it out of his mouth. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Continuing his almost violent rocking, Jeremy sang,</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c11">&ldquo;Fastest way to clean it off.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c11">Will you put it in her mouth?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace popped the pacifier into the squalling mouth, Jeremy deftly twisting the hand
            closest to the child&rsquo;s mouth to hold it in with the tips of his fingers. &nbsp;Candace could tell she
            was trying to push it back out with her tongue.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, relatively quickly, the screaming plugged, Jeremy&rsquo;s song became more
            quiet, the rocking more gentle, and Mandy finally drifted off to sleep.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace stared at the duo now. &nbsp;Jeremy had looked tired before. &nbsp;Near death
            would better describe his current state.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a few moments of silence, he whispered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go lay her down
            &ndash;&ldquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before he could finish, Candace held up both hands, her face shocked.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare!&rdquo; she practically hissed. &nbsp;&ldquo;And risk starting that up
            again?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy twisted his mouth in reluctant agreement and settled back some on the couch.
            &nbsp;Mandy sighed and snuggled up to his chest but didn&rsquo;t wake up. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But I need to fix your car,&rdquo; he said, his voice no longer a whisper, but
            quiet.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;My car can wait,&rdquo; Candace ordered, thinking, If that starts up again,
            I&rsquo;ll </span><span class="c4">walk</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;out of here. &nbsp;Sighing, she said,
            &ldquo;How about I get us something to drink. &nbsp;You need food or something?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy smiled shyly, apology constantly present in his eyes. &nbsp;Nodding
            reluctantly, he said, &ldquo;That would be great. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m starving. &nbsp;I know there&rsquo;s bread
            out there. &nbsp;Probably bologna in the fridge. &nbsp;Peanut butter in the cabinet. &nbsp;Nothing too
            fancy, I&rsquo;m afraid.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without saying anything, Candace went into the kitchen to prepare sandwiches.
            &nbsp;Like the rest of the house, the kitchen wasn&rsquo;t fancy, or particularly well stocked, but it was
            neat, the food in the refrigerator carefully packaged, the cabinets nicely organized. &nbsp;It was obvious
            that nothing went to waste in this house. &nbsp;A few minutes later, Jeremy and Candace were munching on
            bologna sandwiches and drinking iced tea.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace looked closely at Jeremy. &nbsp;The reporter in her had filled up on
            questions throughout her morning in the home.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Jeremy,&rdquo; she said as gently as possible, &ldquo;where are your
            parents?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was obvious to the reporter side of Candace that she had just asked a question the
            boy was not in the habit of answering. &nbsp;She saw his personal privacy fence quickly rise in his eyes.
            &nbsp;But then he looked down at his sleeping sister and sighed. &nbsp;Candace assumed he saw her as
            low-risk when he began to answer.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;They been gone awhile,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;My Dad died from wounds he
            got in Iraq. &nbsp;My Mom. . . Well, I&rsquo;m not sure where she is. &nbsp;She just had all she could take,
            I guess.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In her training as an interviewer, Candace had learned many tricks to keep her
            subjects talking. &nbsp;The goal was to get them so relaxed, or so rattled in some cases, that they would
            forget she was a reporter and tell her more than they had anticipated saying. &nbsp;She kept her face
            sympathetic without being condescending, interested without being demanding.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry,&rdquo; she said, her voice adding an ellipsis to the end of
            it, knowing he would continue. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He did.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Their father had been a sergeant in the Army, deployed to Iraq at the beginning of
            the War. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d disappeared from his platoon and was later charged with being A.W.O.L. and
            dishonorably discharged. &nbsp;Injured during his time away from his group, he required more medical care
            once he got home. &nbsp;Due to the discharge, however, he was no longer covered under military medical.
            &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It was a nightmare,&rdquo; Jeremy said, taking a swallow of his tea.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;My Mom&rsquo;s job had no medical benefits. &nbsp;She was expecting Mandy here. &nbsp;They were
            denied for public assistance. &nbsp;My Dad just got weaker and weaker. &nbsp;Until I guess his heart just
            gave out.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy glanced over at her, then back at the glass in his right hand, then at his
            sleeping sister still cradled in his other arm.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace&rsquo;s news instinct was tweaked. &nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she asked,
            encouragingly yet gently.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what we told the family,&rdquo; Jeremy said very quietly, as if
            the house itself wasn&rsquo;t supposed to hear the words.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy cleared his throat, wouldn&rsquo;t look up. &nbsp;&ldquo;We &ndash; my Mom and
            me &ndash; we told the family that his heart just gave out. &nbsp;Really, he had to stop taking a couple of
            his medications because they couldn&rsquo;t get them anymore. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s really what killed
            him.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace&rsquo;s brow furrowed deeply as she watched Jeremy&rsquo;s face.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;And your Mom?&rdquo; she prompted in a quiet voice.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy cleared his throat again, stared down at Mandy. &nbsp;&ldquo;Dad died just
            after Mandy was born. &nbsp;Mom left two months later. &nbsp;The whole thing broke her. &nbsp;She never was
            all that strong. &nbsp;It was Dad that held us all together. &nbsp;We hated when he was deployed. &nbsp;With
            him gone, she just couldn&rsquo;t do it anymore. &nbsp;We got up one morning and she was gone.
            &nbsp;She&rsquo;s never come back.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace&rsquo;s mouth was uncharacteristically open in shock.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How did you keep the house?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It was my grandparents&rsquo;. &nbsp;Paid for. &nbsp;Between me and Penny, we
            save enough to pay the taxes every year.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Jeremy, how old are you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy grinned over at her. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m nineteen. &nbsp;Penny is
            seventeen. &nbsp;We&rsquo;ve got a pretty good system going here. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re both going to get our
            G.E.D.s one day. &nbsp;The only one I really worry about is Richie. &nbsp;He was closest to Mom and old
            enough to understand what was going on&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy stopped, his face turning red. &nbsp;Candace recognized the signs of someone
            who just realized he had said too much. &nbsp; Doing some quick damage control, she made sure her voice held
            only admiration and no condemnation when she said, &ldquo;So you&rsquo;re doing all this
            yourselves?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nodding, Jeremy smiled down at his sleeping sister. &nbsp;&ldquo;Not always so great
            a job,&rdquo; he said, his eyes smiling at Candace with remembrance of the past hour. &nbsp;&ldquo;But we do
            okay.&rdquo; &nbsp;He tipped his head back on the couch, his eyes closed. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Interview over, Candace thought, smiling to herself. &nbsp;Crossing her legs, the top
            leg bouncing, Candace frowned. &nbsp;This, she thought, is a story. &nbsp;Is that why I&rsquo;m here?
            &nbsp;For the story? &nbsp;Elliott had said it was all about being prepared. &nbsp;He had been given the
            opportunity to sing one of his songs and hadn&rsquo;t been ready. &nbsp;Here she was being given the works
            for a good story. &nbsp;Candace&rsquo;s mind went to the lead line, the angle of the story. &nbsp;As her
            eyes scanned the room, the print rolled through her head of her description of the place. &nbsp;She pictured
            herself back here with a cameraman, saw the drawings on the wall as they would appear in the lens. &nbsp;The
            help would come pouring in for these kids and she would be in the spotlight. &nbsp;She envisioned
            positioning the camera to show her also &ndash; maybe with little Joy on her lap! &nbsp;Candace smiled and
            nodded.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Funny thing was,&rdquo; Jeremy said, causing Candace to snap out of her
            reverie and look over at him. &nbsp;He was looking up at the ceiling. &nbsp;&ldquo;Funny thing was, my Dad
            never was A.W.O.L. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d been injured and when he came around, his squad was gone. &nbsp;An Iraqi
            family took him in to help him. &nbsp;When he could travel, he found his way back to his men. &nbsp;They had
            moved him from M.I.A. to A.W.O.L. and discharged him.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace stared, thunderstruck. &nbsp;In one statement, she went from human interest
            feature to investigative news. &nbsp;And one step closer to that anchor desk.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Jeremy,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I need some paper and a pen.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>

    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">By some miracle, Mandy stayed asleep and Jeremy stayed awake. &nbsp;Following his
            instructions, Candace had located some paper and scrounged up three stubby pencils. &nbsp;Using her own
            brand of shorthand developed over the years during interviews, Candace jotted notes as Jeremy talked again,
            telling his father&rsquo;s story in as much detail as he knew.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy&rsquo;s father, Staff Sergeant Clarence &ldquo;Chuck&rdquo; Taylor, had been
            moving with his platoon through a remote area when they were suddenly fired upon from the hills. &nbsp;The
            men had scattered, taking cover among rocks and trees as best they could, returning fire, but blindly.
            &nbsp;Chuck didn&rsquo;t know how long the battle raged because he was hit in the first round and was flung
            down an embankment, his body coming to rest among some scrub bushes, hiding him from sight. &nbsp;He
            surmised later that his platoon must have scattered and pulled out pretty quickly, choosing to pull back and
            regroup rather than engage since the enemy was hidden. &nbsp;Otherwise they would have done a thorough
            search and rescue and would likely have found him. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d seen skirmishes like that which were
            massive confusion. &nbsp;Only later could you do a headcount and hope everyone was there. &nbsp;When they
            discovered Sgt. Taylor missing, they would have sent a smaller squad to find him. &nbsp; When they
            didn&rsquo;t, he was listed as missing in action.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In the meantime, Sgt. Taylor woke up in the small crude home of an Iraqi family,
            living outside the city in a remote area, trying to live as if their country wasn&rsquo;t being ravaged by
            war and death. &nbsp;Fluent in English, they had explained that they were opposed to their government, and
            were trying to keep a low profile out in the desert, praying to Allah that the war would not find them.
            &nbsp;One of the children, out playing, brought the war home to them when he found the wounded and
            unconscious American soldier. &nbsp;The family brought him home, the parents expertly tending his wounds,
            and nursing him through several days of fever and delirium. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was two weeks before Chuck was coherent enough to realize that he was lost from
            his battalion, but still too weak to do anything about it. &nbsp;His radio was useless, damaged in the fall,
            and the family had no means of communication. &nbsp;It was too risky to send anyone out in search of his
            men, and the area where they lived was so remote, the chances of any troops coming that way were almost nil.
            &nbsp;So Sgt. Taylor did the only thing he could do: &nbsp;gain his strength as quickly as possible to get
            back.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">That would prove to be more difficult than expected. &nbsp;The bullets which had
            riddled his body had gone right through, but internal damage was worse than first thought. &nbsp;He was very
            weak, very sick, his body not functioning properly in many ways. &nbsp;To make matters even worse, his left
            leg was almost useless. &nbsp;Walking was, at first, impossible, only improving to barely possible.
            &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Desperation set in. &nbsp;Chuck knew he had to find his way back to his men. &nbsp;If
            they hadn&rsquo;t found him, they would have declared him missing, presumed dead, and would have informed
            his family. &nbsp;He also knew he had to get back because he was no longer improving, was indeed getting
            worse, and he knew he would surely die in this place. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, with tremendous gratitude to the family, giving them, against their
            protests, all the money he carried on him, Sgt. Taylor accepted a leather skin of water and a heavy branch
            to use as a crutch, and went out in search of his men. &nbsp;It took two full days of walking before he
            finally saw an approaching U.S. motorcade. &nbsp;By then he was so weak, he was closer to dead than alive.
            &nbsp;He collapsed in front of the vehicles and woke up several days later in a military hospital in
            Germany. &nbsp;But that was when his nightmare really began.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">His first conscious knowledge was a military doctor informing him that he was being
            transferred home, Texas, to a civilian hospital there and that the Army&rsquo;s responsibility stopped
            there. &nbsp;Totally confused, too sick to fully understand what was happening, it wasn&rsquo;t until he was
            transferred home that Sgt. Taylor found out he had been dishonorably discharged due to being absent without
            leave. &nbsp;Away from his platoon, unable to connect with his commanding officers, Chuck never knew with
            certainty what had happened. &nbsp;His best guess was someone, an Army scout perhaps, had seen him at the
            Iraqi home and reported him there and not under duress. &nbsp;That would be enough to have him declared
            A.W.O.L. &nbsp;No longer having his military resources, and unable to afford civilian help, Chuck
            didn&rsquo;t know how to fight the system that was denying he and his family the benefits due him.
            &nbsp;Also unable to afford the hospital bills, he checked himself out of the hospital.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He survived only a few more months. &nbsp;Unable to fight the war at home that would
            get his family public assistance and him the insurance he needed for the necessary medical care, Staff
            Sergeant Clarence Taylor died disillusioned, angry, and very frightened for his family. &nbsp;His wife,
            never strong, and unable to cope, left a short time later, leaving their five children to fend for
            themselves.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace sat back in the chair, flipping through the papers, frowning at her notes and
            putting the story together in her head. &nbsp;This family had a major lawsuit on their hands. &nbsp;Candace
            thought through what they would need to investigate, what documents they would need, in order to prove the
            case. &nbsp;She knew just which sources she would call. &nbsp;The story would start with a general
            attention-getter. &nbsp;Sympathy for the family would be strong, public outcry loud. &nbsp;They would read
            some of the emails from the public on the news throughout the first week. &nbsp;Updates toward the end of
            the week would keep interest piqued. &nbsp;She would be able to demand desk time to make the reports herself
            after the first two films aired. &nbsp;That would demonstrate to the producers and station owners that she
            had the type of studio camera presence to carry the full news and not just individual stories. &nbsp;She
            would be a shoo-in for the news anchor spot when it formally opened.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace smiled and sighed contentedly.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She looked up when she saw Jeremy moving. &nbsp;&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo;
            &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have to lay her down,&rdquo; he said quietly. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve got
            her sleeping about six hours at night and about five during the day so Penny and I can both get some sleep.
            &nbsp;If I don&rsquo;t lay her down, she&rsquo;ll wake up early and Penny will have a devil of a time with
            her tonight.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Guilt burned her face as Candace watched Jeremy, his eyes red-rimmed with fatigue,
            carry Mandy out of the room and up the stairs. &nbsp;She hadn&rsquo;t thought about the fact that he had
            just come off a night shift and this was his time to sleep. &nbsp;And he still had to fix her car.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace frowned. &nbsp;Fix the car, then what? &nbsp;Thinking of Hal, Elliott, and
            Ariadne, Candace wondered if she was free of the yellow house. &nbsp;Was this her second chance? &nbsp;Her
            opportunity of a lifetime? &nbsp;She chewed on the inside of her lip as she thought about what the whole
            thing meant. &nbsp;Was this just a dream, or was she truly being given a chance to write a career-advancing
            story? &nbsp;Would she be &ldquo;allowed&rdquo; to go back to the city and continue with the story?
            &nbsp;Maybe the idea was to keep her out of that ill-fated store when the storm hit. &nbsp;She looked up as
            Jeremy came back into the room, a baby monitor in his hand. &nbsp;He set the monitor on the table in front
            of the couch, then stood there, his fingers tucked into his jeans pockets. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I better go get that car fixed,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;You mind
            listening out for Mandy? &nbsp;If you hear anything through here,&rdquo; he nodded toward the monitor,
            &ldquo;just come holler at me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace nodded and watched him walk out the door, holding the screen so it
            didn&rsquo;t slam behind him. &nbsp;Frowning, Candace acknowledged the guilt that was plaguing her.
            &nbsp;This boy&rsquo;s only time to sleep was now. &nbsp;With the story telling she&rsquo;d made him do, and
            now the car repair, he wouldn&rsquo;t get any sleep before he had to go back to work again tonight.
            &nbsp;But what choice did she have? &nbsp;She had to get this story to the station.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace walked around the coffee table to sit on the couch, spreading the papers
            across the table in front of her. &nbsp;Scanning the pages, she penciled in notations as she thought of
            connections, angles, subjects of research. &nbsp; She marked the sections she would do again with Jeremy on
            film and bracketed the parts she would quote directly on her voice-over. &nbsp;Furious at the loss of her
            phone, she marked at the bottom of the pages who she would have to call for verification, counsel, and
            interviews. &nbsp;Looking at the stubby pencil lead, she grinned. &nbsp;It had been a long time since this
            work was done on paper. &nbsp;She hadn&rsquo;t realized she could still do it without her smartphone and
            netbook.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After several minutes of working, she leaned back on the couch and looked around the
            room, the metallic sounds of Jeremy working in the yard in the background. &nbsp;On the wall in front of the
            couch was a simple row of the children&rsquo;s school pictures. &nbsp;The first two were Jeremy and Penny,
            obviously taken a few years earlier. &nbsp;The third was Richie, not smiling, his eyes almost haunting in
            their gaze. &nbsp;That boy is going to need therapy, Candace thought, and smiled when she thought about the
            money the family would get as a result of the story. &nbsp;The next picture was Joy. &nbsp;Candace, still
            smiling, shook her head. &nbsp;That child was special. &nbsp;A warm feeling began to grow in Candace as she
            thought about the brighter future the little girl would have now. &nbsp;There was no picture of Mandy on the
            school wall, of course, but &ndash; as if the child knew &ndash; Candace right then heard a little squeaking
            noise from the monitor. &nbsp;Holding her breath, she prayed silently that the noise would stop.
            &nbsp;He&rsquo;s got to finish that car, she thought, willing the child to stay asleep. &nbsp;After a few
            minutes with no further noise, Candace sighed with relief and looked back at her papers.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her hand looked funny. &nbsp;Candace held her hand up in front of her. &nbsp;It felt
            tingly, like it was asleep.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh no.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bolting up from the couch, Candace looked around desperately. &nbsp;&ldquo;No!&rdquo;
            she said loudly, then looked apologetically at the baby monitor, holding her breath. &nbsp;No sound from
            Mandy.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I can&rsquo;t leave now! &nbsp;She thought, looking down at the papers on the table.
            &nbsp;I have to do this story!</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She held both hands up in front of her. &nbsp;They looked normal. &nbsp;Felt normal.
            &nbsp;Candace fell back onto the couch in relief. &nbsp;But it </span><span class="c4">had</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;happened, almost as a warning. &nbsp;She knew beyond doubt she was about to buzz out of
            this place.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">And go where? &nbsp;Would she be back home, back at the station, or back in that
            blasted yellow house with the other three? &nbsp;Candace frowned, tried to force some clarity into her
            thoughts. &nbsp;Elliott had gone and come back. &nbsp;But he had blown the reason he was there. &nbsp;She
            was obviously here for this story, but if she left now, she wouldn&rsquo;t have a chance to prove herself.
            &nbsp;Maybe she&rsquo;d already done what she was supposed to and now she was going to get to go back to her
            real life and finish working the story.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Or maybe, she realized slowly, the dawning idea causing her frown to deepen, maybe I
            was here for another reason. &nbsp;Maybe, she thought, the words moving lazily through her mind, the
            comprehension of each word coming slowly and almost painfully, maybe . . . it&rsquo;s. . . not. . . the
            story. &nbsp;Candace looked up again from her position on the couch at the pictures on the wall.
            &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She&rsquo;d had a journalism professor in college who taught a section on personal
            interest pieces. &nbsp;&ldquo;Fluff,&rdquo; Candace and most of her classmates had complained. &nbsp;The
            professor looked like the woman on the Betty Crocker cookbook cover and occasionally slipped and referred to
            her college students as &ldquo;boys and girls.&rdquo; &nbsp;Candace usually did work on her phone or netbook
            under the table while the woman taught. &nbsp;But one day when they came into the class, the usually
            talkative and animated teacher was just standing at the front of the room, the podium in front of her, the
            screen pulled down over the whiteboard behind her. &nbsp;She stood silently while the class filed in and
            took their seats. &nbsp;Then she looked slowly around the room and said, &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was silence and nervous glances around the room, a few embarrassed
            grins.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why,&rdquo; she repeated, &ldquo;do we do this job? &nbsp;What is the
            point?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace grinned and looked down, wondering if she was witnessing a journalistic
            breakdown like she saw in a movie once.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;One answer,&rdquo; the teacher said. &nbsp;She looked slowly around the room,
            then, without a word, turned and lifted the screen behind her. &nbsp;On the board, previously covered by the
            screen, were two words:</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The People.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without looking back up, she turned and walked out of the room. &nbsp;It was thirty
            minutes before the students got the idea that it was a two-word lecture that day and class was over.
            &nbsp;The woman was back for the next class, as talkative as ever, but she had made her point, and made it
            dramatically.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The people. &nbsp;Candace frowned at the pictures on the wall. &nbsp;Not the story,
            she thought, the idea causing her to flinch, but the people.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Just then her hand tingled again.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace actually growled with frustration as she picked up the least stubby pencil
            and began scribbling furiously on the pages in front of her &ndash; notes of explanation for whoever would
            get the pages, more detail to define her personal shorthand. &nbsp;Grumbling to herself as she wrote,
            Candace tried to think of who would do the best job on the story. &nbsp;Greg would not be detailed enough,
            Phil not tough enough. &nbsp;Still writing, Candace marched through more names, dismissing each one for
            various reasons. &nbsp;Stopping suddenly, she looked down at the top paper. &nbsp;She had just written a
            name across the top of the page. &nbsp;Shocked, barely recognizing that she had written it, Candace stared
            at the name. &nbsp;It was her competition for the anchor position. &nbsp;Sighing, Candace laid the pencil
            down on the stack of papers. &nbsp;She&rsquo;ll do the best job, she admitted. &nbsp;Grinning and shaking
            her head, she thought, She&rsquo;ll probably do a better job than I would.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The tingling was getting worse. &nbsp;Sighing with a new resolve, Candace picked up a
            blank piece of paper and wrote another note on it, placing it next to the stack of interview notes.
            &nbsp;Standing, she ran her tingling hands down her thighs and looked around the room. &nbsp;She could hear
            thunder in the distance. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Maybe, she thought. &nbsp;Maybe I&rsquo;ll end up at the station. &nbsp;But somehow
            she knew that wasn&rsquo;t true.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her feet were beginning to prickle and she was getting a little light-headed.
            &nbsp;She had to hurry.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Walking out to the porch, she took the steps carefully. &nbsp;Jeremy&rsquo;s head was
            under the hood of the car. &nbsp;&ldquo;Jeremy.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boy looked up, stepped around the car, wiping his hands on a dirty rag.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;She wake up?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It took a moment for Candace to realize what he was asking. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh, no.
            &nbsp;Sound asleep. &nbsp;Listen, I have to go &ndash;&ldquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be done in a bit, but I&rsquo;m
            having trouble &ndash;&ldquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; Candace interrupted, holding up her hand. &nbsp;&ldquo;I, uh, my
            boss is meeting me just up the road.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy frowned and tipped his head.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I totally forgot that he said that he&rsquo;d meet me up here at, uh,&rdquo;
            she looked at her watch, hoped it was the right time, &ldquo;one o&rsquo;clock. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s going to be
            a little ticked that I didn&rsquo;t work on the job he gave me.&rdquo; &nbsp;She laughed nervously, squeezed
            her tingling fingers. &nbsp;&ldquo;Anyway, I&rsquo;ll walk down to meet him, but I have some really
            important things I need you to hear. &nbsp;Okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy was still frowning, but stopped wiping his hands, crossed his arms, and
            nodded. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace took a breath. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay. &nbsp;First, I&rsquo;ve put all my notes
            together in there from talking to you. &nbsp;You have a real case here, Jeremy. &nbsp;I think you and your
            family stand a very good chance of getting the help that your father earned and deserved. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve
            written the name of the person to give this to at the top of the paper. &nbsp;Please don&rsquo;t hesitate.
            &nbsp;She&rsquo;ll take care of everything.&rdquo; As she said it, Candace knew in her heart it was true.
            &nbsp;She smiled. &nbsp;&ldquo;Seriously. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re all going to be just fine.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thunder sounded and Candace frowned up at the sky. &nbsp;&ldquo;Second, do you have a
            storm cellar here?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy raised his eyebrows, but nodded over his right shoulder. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah,
            over &ndash;&ldquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; she interrupted. &nbsp;&ldquo;When the children get home, get
            them in that cellar. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s going to be a very bad storm. &nbsp;Take the notes with you.
            &nbsp;What time does Penny get home?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Four.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good,&rdquo; Candace said, calculating in her head. &nbsp;&ldquo;Good.&rdquo;
            &nbsp;The tingling was moving up her legs. &nbsp;She had to get out of there before Jeremy saw a change in
            her.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got to go,&rdquo; she said, and began to walk toward the road.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Please remember what I said about the notes.&rdquo; She picked up the pace, talking over her
            shoulder. &nbsp;&ldquo;Please remember to get the family in the storm cellar.&rdquo; &nbsp;She was
            practically running now. &nbsp;&ldquo;And there&rsquo;s one more note in there for you too. &nbsp;Good luck,
            Jeremy!&rdquo; &nbsp;She was running full-out now, her legs a little shaky. &nbsp;She thought he called
            something after her, but she kept going, anxious to be out of sight before she was truly out of
            sight.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy Taylor watched the woman running down the drive, his confusion complete.
            &nbsp;She hadn&rsquo;t answered about whether she was coming right back for the car. &nbsp;Shrugging, he
            wiped his hands again, dropping the rag on the porch rail. &nbsp;Strangest day ever, he thought, and walked
            slowly into the house. &nbsp;He could probably still get a couple hours sleep. &nbsp;That would be better
            than nothing. &nbsp;He walked over to the coffee table, listening for Mandy in the baby monitor.
            &nbsp;Nothing, thank goodness.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jeremy sat on the couch, weary to his bones. &nbsp;He looked up at the pictures of
            his family on the wall, as was his custom before he went to sleep each day on the couch. &nbsp;Just a visual
            reminder of what it was all about. &nbsp;He grinned. &nbsp;Worth it, he reminded himself, as he did every
            day. &nbsp;Before he lay down on the cushion, he looked at the stack of papers on the table. &nbsp;Frowning
            in puzzlement as he flipped through them, he was thankful he didn&rsquo;t have to make sense of the writing.
            &nbsp;He thought again about what the woman &ndash; Candace? &ndash; had said. &nbsp;Was there really a
            chance that the family could get some help? &nbsp;Jeremy shrugged again, but an odd buzz of excitement had
            started in him when she spoke the words and he knew he would pursue it.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He lay back on the cushions, sleep crowding his brain almost immediately. &nbsp;Just
            before he totally nodded off, he remembered her saying something about another note. &nbsp;Sitting back up,
            he picked up the single piece of paper next to the stack. &nbsp;Reading it, he shook his head in wonder,
            then chuckled lightly. &nbsp;Strange day, indeed. &nbsp;He held the note in his hand as he lay back down,
            asleep almost immediately.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Jeremy,&rdquo; the note said, &ldquo;keep the car. &nbsp;God bless,
            Candace.&rdquo;</span></p>

    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c6 c5"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp; </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh crap.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She was back in the yellow house, in the room designed for her. &nbsp;Somehow she had
            hoped. . . She had come to know that she wasn&rsquo;t going back to the station, but coming back to the
            house meant that the ordeal wasn&rsquo;t over yet. &nbsp;Now what, she thought glumly. &nbsp;Grabbing some
            clean clothes, she went down the hall to the bathroom, locked the door behind her, and started the shower
            water. &nbsp;Leaning on the sink with both hands, she stared at her reflection in the mirror.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Candace Richards, girl reporter.&rdquo; &nbsp;She smirked.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Biggest story of my career and I gave it away.&rdquo; &nbsp;Suddenly, Joy&rsquo;s face came to
            Candace&rsquo;s mind, as did the weary and red-eyed face of Jeremy, the teenager working to support his
            family. &nbsp;Candace felt a heat in her belly &ndash; the kind she got when a story went well, the parts
            falling into place securely, the sound bites perfect in timing and inflection. &nbsp;Straightening up, she
            frowned at herself in the mirror. &nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happening to you?&rdquo; she demanded of her
            reflection. &nbsp;Mumbling to herself about getting soft and losing her edge, she turned away from the
            mirror and toward the shower.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, okay, so. . . &ldquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal and Ariadne looked up from the chairs as Elliott came into the living room.
            &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;El?&rdquo; Hal said.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott looked perplexed and nervous, his hands were gesturing, but only partial
            words were coming out of his mouth. &nbsp;After a moment, he managed, &ldquo;Shower&rsquo;s running, but you
            two are &ndash; that is, we&rsquo;re not &ndash; I mean, well, </span><span class="c4">I&rsquo;m</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;not&hellip;..&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne stood up suddenly. &nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s back?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It took a moment for Hal to grasp what had happened. &nbsp;Suddenly his face lit up.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh! Candace is in the shower! &nbsp;Okay.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott looked relieved to have been understood. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s been gone awhile,&rdquo; Hal said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I
            can&rsquo;t wait to hear what happened to her.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne was sitting back down, but frowning. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Hal asked.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne twisted her mouth to the side. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well, I know this sounds strange,
            but I was rather hoping she wouldn&rsquo;t come back.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott was dropping down on the couch across from them. &nbsp;&ldquo;I know what you
            mean,&rdquo; he said, stretching his legs out and planting his feet on the glass coffee table.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean I like her and all, but she&rsquo;s not exactly the life of the party, if you get my
            meaning.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne just stared at him a moment. &nbsp;Hal stifled a grin.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I meant,&rdquo; Ariadne said slowly, &ldquo;that I was hoping she&rsquo;d find
            a way out of here for herself. &nbsp;That she&rsquo;d do whatever it was while she was away that would
            ensure her. . . well, release I suppose.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott&rsquo;s face reddened. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh. &nbsp;Sorry.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal started to speak, but before he could say anything, from behind him he heard,
            &ldquo;Honey, I&rsquo;m home!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The three stood as Candace came down the steps and into the room. &nbsp;Uncomfortable
            silence and embarrassed looks prevailed as Candace, wearing a loose-fitting jogging suit, her hair wet and
            combed back into a ponytail, walked to the couch and sat down, crossing one leg over the other. &nbsp;The
            other three slowly sat down.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well.&rdquo; &nbsp;Candace grinned at them. &nbsp;&ldquo;That was
            interesting.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was a sudden explosion of simultaneous questions from the other three.
            &nbsp;Candace laughed and held up one hand. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll start at
            the beginning, but I have a question first. &nbsp;How long was I gone?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne was the first to answer. &nbsp;&ldquo;A long time! &nbsp;Much longer than
            Elliott. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s so hard to gauge time here, but we&rsquo;ve gone through the rest of that day, a
            night, and most of today.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace&rsquo;s eyes widened. &nbsp;&ldquo;Really! &nbsp;I think I was there for like
            five or six hours is all.&rdquo; &nbsp;She frowned and looked toward the window, her crossed leg swinging.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;And it was still Thursday, the day of the storm.&rdquo; &nbsp;Grinning, Candace added, &ldquo;I
            think I saw a movie like this once.&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal nodded, also grinning. &nbsp;&ldquo;I believe I recall a television series or two
            about this sort of thing, too.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Weird,&rdquo; Candace agreed.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The time thing is really freaking me out!&rdquo; Elliott spouted.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, Hal was gone outside for a long time by his calculations, but to us here it was like no
            time had passed. &nbsp;But Candace and I were gone for relatively short times, but it&rsquo;s a whole lot
            longer here. Days seem to go by here, but when we get zapped back into the world, it&rsquo;s that same day
            over again. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t get it. &nbsp;I really don&rsquo;t get it!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal smiled patiently. &nbsp;&ldquo;None of us get it, Elliott,&rdquo; he said.
            &nbsp;He turned to Candace. &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you want to tell us about what happened?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace, knowing how anxious they were to hear, was tempted to say &ldquo;no&rdquo;
            just for the comical effect. &nbsp;Instead, she pulled her feet up under her in uncharacteristic relaxation,
            and said, &ldquo;It was the craziest thing&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">For the next several minutes, she told them the story of Jeremy and Penny and the
            children, of Staff Sergeant Clarence Taylor and an injustice done to an American soldier. &nbsp;As she told
            it, she used some of the lines she had planned to use for the broadcast. &nbsp;She was pleased to see the
            effect they had on her audience. &nbsp;She ended with the tingling starting and her having to run.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But,&rdquo; Ariadne had been leaning forward in the chair as Candace spoke.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;But, what was the point? &nbsp;I mean, you got the story, but you can&rsquo;t report the story,
            right? &nbsp;So what was the point? &nbsp;Why were you there?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Flashing quickly on her journalism instructor, Candace found herself saying,
            &ldquo;The people.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal&rsquo;s eyebrows went up in surprise. &nbsp;&ldquo;What are you
            saying?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace cleared her throat and slumped a little on the couch, although it was from
            fatigue rather than from failure. &nbsp;&ldquo;I thought I was there to write the All-American story,&rdquo;
            she said, her voice softer than they&rsquo;d heard it before. &nbsp;&ldquo;I remembered what you said,
            Elliott, about being prepared and not failing at the task given. &nbsp;So I did the best I could to get the
            information I needed, then made notes about who to call and what to do from there. &nbsp;I had the perfect
            story all laid out.&rdquo; &nbsp;She looked at each of them, her eyes weary, but content. &nbsp;&ldquo;And
            then I realized I was leaving. &nbsp;So I had a decision to make.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace smiled, her eyes shining. &nbsp;She was feeling better than she had in a
            long, long time. &nbsp;&ldquo;I had to decide what the point of it was. &nbsp;And I had to admit that the
            point was not for me to tell the story, but simply that the story be told. &nbsp;The important part,&rdquo;
            she said quietly, perhaps more to herself than the others, &ldquo;was that family.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was silence in the room for several minutes. &nbsp;Finally, Candace sighed and
            slapped her hands on her thighs. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So,&rdquo; she said brightly, &ldquo;why the heck am I back here? &nbsp;I kind
            of thought I did my good deed, learned a big lesson, and so I&rsquo;d be buzzed on up and out of here, you
            know?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; Hal said, &ldquo;I was thinking that was it exactly.
            &nbsp;There&rsquo;s something for us to learn, and we&rsquo;re here until we learn it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Or,&rdquo; Ariadne added, &ldquo;something for us to </span><span
            class="c4">do</span><span class="c0">, and we&rsquo;re given the opportunity to do it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was no malice in Candace when she said to Ariadne, &ldquo;So you think I
            didn&rsquo;t do what I was supposed to?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne quickly shook her head. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;It
            seems to me you did just exactly what you were supposed to do. &nbsp;I just can&rsquo;t imagine. . .
            &ldquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was silence for a moment, then Candace smacked her hands on her legs again.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m hungry! &nbsp;That bologna sandwich was a long while
            ago by whatever standard of time you choose to use.&rdquo; &nbsp;She stood and started toward the
            kitchen.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me too!&rdquo; Elliott said and followed her.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Standing, Ariadne looked at Hal, &ldquo;Can I bring you something?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal was still frowning slightly. &nbsp;&ldquo;A cup of coffee?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne smiled. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get Candace to make it,&rdquo; she said,
            walking toward the kitchen.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace and Elliott were standing in front of the open refrigerator, staring.
            &nbsp;Ariadne walked up behind them and cleared her throat. &nbsp;&ldquo;Problem?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hungry,&rdquo; Elliott said, not looking at her.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t decide,&rdquo; Candace said, also continuing to stare into the
            refrigerator. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne smiled, waited a moment, then put her two hands between them and pushed them
            gently apart. &nbsp;Bending and looking into the fridge, she moved a few things, opened a few drawers,
            checked compartments on the door.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; she said, standing up and rubbing her hands together, &ldquo;how
            about cheese omelets, hash browns with onions, and buttered toast?&rdquo; &nbsp;When she didn&rsquo;t get an
            answer, she turned and looked at the other two. &nbsp;They were both looking at her with expressions of
            shocked admiration.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can you make that happen?&rdquo; Elliott asked, a sort of wonder in his
            voice.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;If you help,&rdquo; she answered.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott and Candace took a step back. &nbsp;&ldquo;Just tell us what to do!&rdquo;
            Candace said.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">A few moments later, Elliott was peeling potatoes, Candace was shredding cheese, and
            Ariadne was chopping onions. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wow.&rdquo; &nbsp;It was Hal who had just walked into the room.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Quite an operation you have here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne looked up from the onion. &nbsp;&ldquo;Sorry, Hal. &nbsp;I forgot about the
            coffee.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Shaking his head, Hal walked toward the coffee pot. &nbsp;&ldquo;No problem!
            &nbsp;I&rsquo;m on it. &nbsp;Candace?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Make enough for me, too.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In a short time, the meal was done and being piled onto plates. &nbsp;Candace had
            wanted to scour the freezer for bacon, but out of deference for Ariadne had resisted the temptation.
            &nbsp;Sitting again in the living room, the four ate in silence for some time. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a while, Candace said, &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t take this the wrong way, but I
            was really hoping not to come back here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Actually,&rdquo; Ariadne said, grinning over at a blushing Elliott, &ldquo;we
            were rather hoping not to see you here again.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was silence in the room for awhile. &nbsp;Then Elliott said quietly, almost
            fearfully, &ldquo;What if we&rsquo;re here forever?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;How could that be?&rdquo; Candace said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, I don&rsquo;t
            claim to be a Bible scholar or anything, but this doesn&rsquo;t fit anything I&rsquo;ve ever heard about
            Heaven or the afterlife.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne nodded, held a finger up for them to wait while she chewed. &nbsp;Swallowing,
            she said, &ldquo;I thought for a little while that God had nothing to do with this, that it was some sort of
            cosmic mess-up. &nbsp;But now I don&rsquo;t think so. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know about the rest of you, but I
            feel Him here. &nbsp;Actually, I&rsquo;m feeling His presence more and more. &nbsp;Maybe it just took
            getting me out of my routine, but I feel closer to Him somehow.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace nodded thoughtfully. &nbsp;&ldquo;Someone guided what I did with Jeremy and
            his family,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I know </span><span class="c4">I</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;wouldn&rsquo;t have done it that way.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I agree,&rdquo; Elliott said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I knew He was showing me my purpose
            for being in that club.&rdquo; &nbsp;He looked over at Hal who was watching the floor. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hal? You
            don&rsquo;t agree?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal was frowning. &nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t disagree,&rdquo; he said finally.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re just telling how you feel. &nbsp;Nobody can disagree with your feelings.
            &nbsp;But,&rdquo; he added, still making very little eye contact, &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t say that I&rsquo;ve
            felt the same thing.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Really?&rdquo; Candace said, her head tipping. &nbsp;&ldquo;How do
        </span><span class="c4">you</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;feel?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal looked up and at her for a long time, Candace holding his gaze patiently.
            &nbsp;It seemed he was making a decision and, when he finally spoke, had decided to take the risk.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t feel much of anything where God is
            concerned.&rdquo; &nbsp;There was absolute silence in the room. &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, I </span><span
            class="c4">am</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a Christian. &nbsp;I still pray and go to church. &nbsp;I just
            don&rsquo;t. . . Well, I don&rsquo;t know. &nbsp;I just don&rsquo;t </span><span class="c4">feel</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;anything. &nbsp;My head knows it&rsquo;s true and I still believe in my salvation and in
            the gospel, so to speak. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s just no&hellip;.&rdquo; He finally trailed off,
            shrugging.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Relationship?&rdquo; Ariadne finished for him.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal looked over at her, squinting thoughtfully. &nbsp;&ldquo;Right. &nbsp;I guess
            that&rsquo;s it. &nbsp;We co-exist. &nbsp;Sort of like&mdash;&ldquo; &nbsp;Embarrassed that he&rsquo;d said
            too much, Hal cleared his throat and looked down at the floor again.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott was the first to say what they were thinking. &nbsp;&ldquo;Sort of like
            what?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other two, wanting to chastise him, but glad he had asked, turned their reddening
            faces downward, avoiding eye contact.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal stared at Elliott for a moment, seemingly analyzing again how much to say.
            &nbsp;Finally, he threw one hand in the air in frustration. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m
            worried about,&rdquo; he said a little too loud. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not like you know my family or that
            we&rsquo;ll ever see each other again. &nbsp;Or maybe it&rsquo;s that we&rsquo;ll never see them again.
            &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo; &nbsp;He seemed on the verge of anger.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sort of like me and my family, Elliott. &nbsp;We co-exist. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve
            been sitting here listening to Candace talk about that young family and as poor as they are and as hard as
            they have it, you know what? I envy them! &nbsp;If any one of them was here, the others would be going
            crazy. &nbsp;They would be </span><span class="c4">missed</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;My family would
            miss the </span><span class="c4">idea</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;of me more than the real me. &nbsp;Even
            my wife. &nbsp;We live in the same house, but we are not together. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know how much longer
            we can keep up the fa&ccedil;ade.&rdquo; &nbsp;He chuckled and shook his head. &nbsp;&ldquo;Guess now we
            don&rsquo;t have to worry about that either.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a long silence, it was Candace who spoke. &nbsp;&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re angry
            with God about all that?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal looked quickly up at her. &nbsp;He opened and closed his mouth twice before he
            finally spoke, his face going from surprised to angry to a type of calm acceptance. &nbsp;Nodding, he said,
            &ldquo;Yeah, I guess I am. &nbsp;Nothing in my life is working out the way I thought it was supposed to.
            &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve tried to be obedient to what He wanted, tried to be led, but where has it gotten me?
            &nbsp;A job I hate, two kids who ignore me, and a wife who doesn&rsquo;t know me anymore.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wow&hellip;.&rdquo; Elliott said after a pause. &nbsp;&ldquo;I had you pegged
            as the level-headed one in this group.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The three stared at him for a moment, then burst into simultaneous, albeit nervous,
            laughter. &nbsp;Even Hal chuckled. &nbsp;Elliott looked confused, but relieved.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; Hal said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m still pretty
            good about doing the &lsquo;right thing.&rsquo; &nbsp;I just sometimes wish my heart could catch up with my
            brain.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne reached across the table between them and patted his hand. &nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe
            that&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;re here,&rdquo; she said, smiling kindly at him. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal looked thoughtful, picked up his coffee cup and took the last cold swallow.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe,&rdquo; he said quietly, then quickly added, &ldquo;I need some more
            coffee.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other three stood with him and led the way into the kitchen with their empty
            plates. &nbsp;Hearing a small crash, they turned, then gasped.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The empty coffee cup was shattered on the floor. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal was gone.</span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Phil Nixon heard that his big brother and his sister-in-law planned on naming
            their baby boy Harold, he was royally ticked off.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He&rsquo;s gonna get beat up,&rdquo; he complained.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a lengthy argument about the family history of the name, the meaning behind it
            (they swore it meant strong and mighty, but he looked it up in a baby name book and it meant &ldquo;army
            leader&rdquo;), Phil finally begged them to at least call the little fellow Hal. &nbsp;The parents-to-be
            shrugged, Phil took that as agreement, and never called his nephew anything but Hal.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Little Hal was his Uncle Phil&rsquo;s shadow. &nbsp;A dad busy with a white collar
            job, and a mom who followed up on her baby-delivering success by having twin girls fourteen months later,
            little Hal adored the attention by his uncle and was happy to be his constant tagalong. &nbsp;It was Uncle
            Phil who taught him to throw a ball, ride a bike, and later to target shoot with arrows and, much later,
            guns (he was sworn to secrecy about that one). &nbsp;Uncle Phil took him to ball games, taught him that real
            men love music, made sure he had cool t-shirts and ball caps to wear. &nbsp;Uncle Phil taught him to spit,
            cuss, and, when he was too young to know he was doing it for the benefit of his Uncle Phil, bat his eyes at
            cute women. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The one thing Uncle Phil didn&rsquo;t teach him was how to swim. &nbsp;Big, tough,
            larger-than-life Uncle Phil had one Achilles heel &ndash; he was mortally afraid of water. &nbsp;A
            near-drowning incident as a very young child could never be entirely overcome. &nbsp;Although he tried never
            to let his nephew see his fear, it didn&rsquo;t take a genius to figure it out. &nbsp;Once, on a trip to San
            Antonio to see the Alamo, the two walked along the Riverwalk. &nbsp;Hal was fascinated and walked on the
            edge, looking down into the water. &nbsp;Phil, as close to the shops or walls as he could get, could finally
            stand it no more and snatched his nephew suddenly away, mounted the next set of steps, and went up to street
            level. &nbsp;He had to sit down on a bench to get his breathing back to normal. &nbsp;Hal was six and the
            fear registered. &nbsp;His boy&rsquo;s mind reasoned that if Uncle Phil was afraid of it, it was truly a
            force to be feared. &nbsp;From that point on, Hal, too, avoided water.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">And now here he sat. &nbsp;In a boat, alone, nothing but water all around him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal gripped the edges of the small craft and looked around. &nbsp;He was in just a
            small boat, three plank seats going from side to side. &nbsp;He was on the back seat. &nbsp;Behind him was a
            motor. &nbsp;He recognized it as the type you crank up like a lawn mower, then use the protruding stick to
            steer.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Steer where? &nbsp;Hal squinted into the sun and looked around, never letting go of
            the sides of the boat. &nbsp;There didn&rsquo;t appear to be land anywhere. &nbsp;Hal felt his heart
            beginning to race, his body going cold, then immediately hot. &nbsp;Darkening clouds slid over the sun and
            gave him some relief from the glare and the heat. &nbsp;May in Texas is August elsewhere. &nbsp;If, indeed,
            that&rsquo;s when it was. &nbsp;And where he was.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal felt his stomach rumble and willed himself to calm down. &nbsp;He looked up and
            cocked his head to one side.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Water?&rdquo; he said out loud. &nbsp;&ldquo;Really?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frowning, Hal shook his head. &nbsp;Elliott got music, Candace got a story.
            &nbsp;What does he get? &nbsp;His number one fear. &nbsp;Lovely.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The bobbing of the boat in the slightly choppy water threatened both to unnerve Hal
            even more and put his nervous stomach right over the edge. &nbsp;Forcing himself to watch the water, he
            realized it appeared to be moving against him, meaning, if his non-nautical sense was correct, land was
            likely behind him. &nbsp;Good enough for me, he thought, and turned to the motor to try to figure out how to
            use it. &nbsp;It had a pull cord, a lot like a lawn mower. &nbsp;Hal pulled. &nbsp;Nothing happened.
            &nbsp;He pulled harder. &nbsp;On the third try the motor cranked. &nbsp;The boat, however, didn&rsquo;t
            move.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal frowned. &nbsp;Using his engineer&rsquo;s brain, he examined the motor.
            &nbsp;There was a knob on the side by him, like a lawn mower choke. &nbsp;Looking upward again and shaking
            his head, acknowledging the on-going cosmic joke, Hal pulled the knob all the way out. &nbsp;The boat
            lurched forward.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lurching was not something Hal was prepared for. &nbsp;He bounced off the plank seat,
            the boat twisting in the water as Hal&rsquo;s hand was ripped from the rudder stick. &nbsp;Crying out, Hal
            desperately grabbed the sides of the boat again, pulling himself back onto the seat and willing the little
            craft not to flip over. &nbsp;Grabbing the stick to try to steady the boat, Hal at first overcompensated,
            creating a side-to-side flipping that threatened to finally either send him flying over the side of the boat
            or cause him to lose his omelet over the side of the boat. &nbsp;Finally, the boat steadied, but it was
            going too fast and Hal had no idea which direction he was heading. &nbsp;Thinking he just had to stop the
            thing and get his bearings again, but not wanting to let go of the rudder stick, he forced his left hand off
            the side of the boat and reached over to push in the knob in. &nbsp;He only got it part way in when he had
            to grab the side again to balance himself. &nbsp;The boat slowed down.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah, Hal thought. &nbsp;So you&rsquo;re the gas pedal. &nbsp;Right. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Leaving it at that speed, Hal looked around again. &nbsp;Had he turned around?
            &nbsp;What direction was he going? &nbsp;Did it matter, really? &nbsp;Hal squinted into the distance and
            looked as far to his left as he could without turning around or letting go of the stick. &nbsp;Nothing.
            &nbsp;He looked forward again, then moved his head slowly to the right. &nbsp;He considered pushing the knob
            fully back in. &nbsp;It seemed foolish to continue moving and not know where he was heading. &nbsp;But then,
            off to the right, about two o&rsquo;clock, he could see something. &nbsp;Hal frowned. &nbsp;It was too small
            to even tell what it was, but it was something. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Only proverbial fish in this sea, Hal reasoned, moving the rudder stick just enough
            to head him in the direction of whatever it was that had broken the horizon line. &nbsp;Anxious to get to
            anything that might get him out of this water, Hal pulled the knob back out a bit to speed up the boat.
            &nbsp;Trying not to think about all the what-ifs, trying not to think of how very much water was around him,
            and certainly trying not to think of how very much water was </span><span class="c4">below</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;him, Hal focused on the mystery spot and pulled the button out a little bit more.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;It was another boat. &nbsp;Hal groaned when he realized it, but he was
            committed now and felt like continuing toward it. &nbsp;It was a nice boat, a cabin cruiser. &nbsp;Not a
            yacht, but pretty nice sized. &nbsp;As Hal got closer, slowing his little boat down, he could see movement
            on the deck. &nbsp;Someone was standing there. &nbsp;But not just standing &ndash; whoever it was was waving
            their arms wildly, a jacket or something in their hands, waving side to side like a flag. &nbsp;Frowning,
            Hal pulled the knob out a bit to speed up. &nbsp;It was a lady and she seemed frantic.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">As Hal got closer, he could hear her yelling. &nbsp;&ldquo;Help! &nbsp;Please
            stop!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Wondering briefly where she thought he was going, Hal waved back to encourage her,
            then awkwardly steered his little craft around to the back of her larger one where he saw there was a
            platform where he could get onto her boat. &nbsp;His heart catching at the thought of the transition from
            boat to boat, Hal pushed the button in, killing the engine. &nbsp;He looked over helplessly as he drifted
            past the boat, but didn&rsquo;t have to worry long. &nbsp;A rope landed in front of him.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Grab it!&rdquo; It was the woman, holding her end of the rope. &nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal obediently grabbed the rope. &nbsp;The woman brought up the slack in the line,
            then pulled, Hal and his little craft sliding backward until the side of his boat was right up against the
            back of the woman&rsquo;s. &nbsp;Hal saw she was tying the rope off to a ring on the back of her boat.
            &nbsp;Praying quickly, he stood, the boat rocking, his arms shooting out to the side to balance him.
            &nbsp;The woman was there, leaning toward him, holding out her hand. &nbsp;Her face was strained, pinched
            with worry and fear.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh please hurry,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;It was more of a prayer than a
            reprimand.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Worried now, Hal took her hand and stepped from the small craft onto the larger one.
            &nbsp;Suddenly he found himself being embraced by the woman who began sobbing into his chest. &nbsp;His
            eyebrows up, Hal slowly brought his arms around her, but not touching her, patting her reassuringly with the
            tips of his fingers.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s-?&rdquo; But that&rsquo;s as far as he got. &nbsp;The woman
            suddenly straightened, wiping her eyes and shaking her head.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh thank God you&rsquo;re here! &nbsp;Please, hurry. &nbsp;My husband&hellip;.
            Do you have a cell phone?&rdquo; &nbsp;Her face was frantic.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal found himself patting his pockets. &nbsp;&ldquo;Uh, no &ndash; &ldquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then she was off like a shot, a confused Hal hurrying to keep up with her.
            &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">They went through the open back of the boat, and down some steps into a darker area.
            &nbsp;Hal could see through open doors a kitchen area, a bathroom, and at least two bedrooms. &nbsp;He
            couldn&rsquo;t help but thinking if he could park this thing on concrete, he wouldn&rsquo;t mind living in
            it. &nbsp;The woman went through the open door straight ahead &ndash; another bedroom. &nbsp;Only this one
            was occupied. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">A man lay on the bed. &nbsp;He was on his back, his right leg raised up on a platform
            of pillows. &nbsp;There was a towel or something wrapped around his lower leg and it was soaked through with
            blood. &nbsp;The woman was up at the man&rsquo;s head, brushing back his hair, picking up a nearby cloth and
            wiping his face. &nbsp;Hal could hear her talking quietly. &nbsp;As he approached, he heard,
            &ldquo;Someone&rsquo;s here. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s a miracle. &nbsp;You&rsquo;ll be okay now, you&rsquo;ll
            see.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal stopped and took in the picture as quickly as possible. &nbsp;The man was
            probably forty. &nbsp;He appeared to be conscious, but just barely. &nbsp;His hair was wet. &nbsp;He was
            wearing what appeared to be swimming trunks &ndash; the old fashioned, non-embarrassing kind, Hal noticed.
            &nbsp;He had a short-sleeved shirt on, unbuttoned to his navel. &nbsp;He was frowning, his eyes closed and
            his head lolling a bit on the pillow. &nbsp;He appeared to be trying to speak.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The woman shushed him, looking frantically at Hal. &nbsp;Funny he hadn&rsquo;t
            noticed before, but she was gorgeous. &nbsp;She couldn&rsquo;t have been more than thirty, if that.
            &nbsp;Blonde hair that she was given at birth and not at the hairdresser. &nbsp;She was wearing a bikini
            with a sheer cover over it. &nbsp;She had model-perfect skin and body. &nbsp;Hal suddenly realized she
            looked very familiar.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Please help him,&rdquo; she said, her voice strained but not panicked.
            &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Startled into movement, Hal moved forward toward the bed. &nbsp;&ldquo;What
            happened?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The woman continued to wipe the man&rsquo;s face with the cloth. &nbsp;&ldquo;The
            boat quit. &nbsp;There&rsquo;s a something-or-other that keeps messing up in the motor. &nbsp;Kenny knows
            all about it, so he jumped in to fix it. &nbsp;Then as he was swimming away, it came on all of a sudden.
            &nbsp;We had forgotten to turn it off up here. &nbsp;His leg got pulled in and the propeller blade tore it
            up.&rdquo; &nbsp;Her voice caught and she looked over at Hal, new tears on her face. &nbsp;&ldquo;Do
            something.&rdquo; She pleaded. &nbsp;&ldquo;Get us out of here. &nbsp;He needs a doctor.&rdquo; &nbsp;The
            tears were flowing freely now.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal saw the man&rsquo;s right arm slowly come up. &nbsp;He took the woman&rsquo;s arm
            in his hand. &nbsp;She gasped and grabbed his hand in both of hers.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Baby! Kenny! &nbsp;Are you okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man&rsquo;s eyes were open. &nbsp;Hal could see the pain was great. &nbsp;His
            voice raspy and barely audible, the man made an attempt at a smile and said, &ldquo;Bibs, can you get me
            some more water?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The woman straightened quickly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Of course!&rdquo; &nbsp;Grabbing the
            empty glass on the table next to the bed, she turned and practically fled past Hal. &nbsp;When he looked
            back at the man on the bed, Hal saw he was being watched. &nbsp;Scrutinized was actually more like it.
            &nbsp;The man made a small movement calling Hal toward him. &nbsp;When he got to the side of the bed, Hal
            was surprised at the amount of suspicion and almost animosity in the man&rsquo;s face. &nbsp;It was the
            oddest mix of fatigue, pain, and anger.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; the man demanded.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Name&rsquo;s Hal Nixon,&rdquo; Hal answered.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where did you come from?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without thinking, Hal answered quickly, &ldquo;I have no idea.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man frowned at him. &nbsp;Winced. &nbsp;Closed his eyes, apparently fighting a
            wave of pain.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The sounds of the approaching woman could be heard. &nbsp;Suddenly, the man grabbed
            Hal&rsquo;s arm with surprising strength.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can I trust you?&rdquo; he said, his eyes probing desperately.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">A wave of compassion rolled over Hal. &nbsp;He laid his hand on top of the
            man&rsquo;s and leaned over the bed. &nbsp;Looking the man in the eye, hoping his sincerity was obvious, Hal
            said, &ldquo;Yes, sir. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll do whatever I can to help.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man watched him for a moment, then Hal felt his entire body relax as he sighed,
            his hand dropping back onto the bed, his eyes closing again.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The woman rushed up with the glass of water, pushing in front of Hal and sliding her
            hand under the man&rsquo;s head to help lift it. After a couple sips of water, she laid his head back on the
            pillow, replaced the glass on the table, wiped his face with the cloth again. &nbsp;She glanced sideways at
            Hal.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What are we going to do?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was afraid she was going to say that.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve radioed for help?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The woman&rsquo;s face became even more tight with worry. &nbsp;Shaking her head, she
            said, &ldquo;Nothing works. &nbsp;We&rsquo;re dead in the water. &nbsp;The stupid motor quit again. &nbsp;I
            can&rsquo;t get a radio signal. &nbsp;My cell phone doesn&rsquo;t even work.&rdquo; &nbsp;The whole time she
            talked, she kept wiping her husband&rsquo;s face with the cloth. &nbsp;Her movements were getting faster,
            jerkier. &nbsp;Hal began to worry that she was about to completely fall apart. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Swallowing hard, Hal took a step toward her and laid a gentle hand on her arm.
            &nbsp;When she looked at him, his heart caught. &nbsp;She was so frightened and looked so vulnerable.
            &nbsp;Hal smiled, hoping it looked genuine and comforting. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ll figure something
            out,&rdquo; he said softly. &nbsp;&ldquo;What&rsquo;s your name?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She looked surprised at the question. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m Bibby Coonts,&rdquo; she
            said as if he should know that. &nbsp;Hal frowned and looked at her a little sideways. &nbsp;Bibby Coonts.
            &nbsp;Not your everyday name&hellip;. Suddenly Hal&rsquo;s eyes widened and the woman smiled for the first
            time. &nbsp;Nodding, she said, &ldquo;I know. &nbsp;I look a little different up close, and with no makeup
            on.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal&rsquo;s mouth had dropped open. &nbsp;He knew he was staring, but couldn&rsquo;t
            stop. &nbsp;Bibby Coonts. &nbsp;Just about the best contemporary blues singer in the world. &nbsp;Hal had
            all her cds, but had never seen her in concert. &nbsp;The photo on the cover of the disc didn&rsquo;t do her
            justice. &nbsp;She lent a sultry, haunting quality to some of the slower, traditional standards, yet could
            transform her voice into a lilting, uplifting near-soprano for some of the faster, more upbeat numbers.
            &nbsp;Not a big fan of contemporary anything, even Hal liked her original music, much of it written by or
            co-written with someone named Kenny Schwartz. &nbsp;Hal&rsquo;s eyes widened again and he looked at the man
            on the bed. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d called him Kenny and referred to him as her husband.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Reading his thoughts, Bibby nodded again. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, this is Kenny Schwartz.
            &nbsp;He&rsquo;s my partner in every sense of the word. &nbsp;We have a house in Dallas, but spend most of
            our time out here on the lake. &nbsp;This has never happened before &ndash; losing all our power.&rdquo;
            &nbsp;She sighed, the frown deepening again as she glanced over at her sleeping or unconscious husband.
            &nbsp;Looking up at Hal, she suddenly tipped her head at him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Where did you come from?&rdquo;
            she asked, unknowingly echoing her husband&rsquo;s question.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal shook his head and waved his hand a little, as if to deflect the question.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;My name is Hal,&rdquo; he said, suddenly feeling like a schoolboy. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hal Nixon.
            &nbsp;I, uh, I have to say that I&rsquo;m, well, I really&hellip;.&rdquo; He wanted to kick himself.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;That is, I truly enjoy your music, Ms. Coonts.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bibby grinned. &nbsp;&ldquo;Bibby, please. &nbsp;And thank you. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t
            know how you got here, but you are like a miracle. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m so worried for Kenny. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s
            lost so much blood.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Snapped out of his idol-worshipping reverie, Hal turned to Kenny. &nbsp;The towel was
            soaked through with blood, the outer edges of it turning dark. &nbsp;He&rsquo;d had it on his leg for
            awhile. &nbsp;&ldquo;Do you have anything else we can put on his leg? &nbsp;A clean sheet
            maybe?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bibby&rsquo;s eyes widened and she ran again from the room. &nbsp;Hal took the
            opportunity to carefully peel the towel wrapping away from Kenny&rsquo;s leg. &nbsp;The man stirred somewhat
            as the covering moved and Hal nearly wretched when he saw the damage done by the boat&rsquo;s propeller.
            &nbsp;It looked more like raw meat than a leg and now that it was unwrapped, Hal could see it was slightly
            twisted at an unnatural angle, the bones obviously broken, if not crushed. &nbsp;Panic began to build with
            the bile in his stomach as he stared at the leg. &nbsp;Frozen by revulsion and ignorance, he just stood
            there, until he felt a hand grip his arm, causing him to startle.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Kenny Schwartz was looking at him, his face pale, his eyes probing.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;s not so tough,&rdquo; he said, the effort to speak obvious. &nbsp;Hal recognized the
            man&rsquo;s need to get it in before she returned. &nbsp;&ldquo;Get her out of here. &nbsp;Bring help back.
            &nbsp;Just&hellip;&rdquo; His body jerked suddenly and he grimaced, his eyes closing. &nbsp;Gasping
            slightly, he looked at Hal, his eyes intense. &nbsp;&ldquo;Get her out of here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal frowned, looked back at the gruesome leg, then up at the eyes of the
            husband.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Trying to sound more sure than he felt, he firmly gripped Kenny&rsquo;s hand.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;re getting you both out of here.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace put down the book she was reading and looked up at Ariadne. &nbsp;They were
            sitting in the spaces that seemed designated for them &ndash; Candace on the right end of the couch, Ariadne
            in the wing-back chair diagonal from her. &nbsp;Ariadne had pulled an ottoman up in front of her chair and
            had her feet resting on it, crossed at the ankles. &nbsp;She was crocheting, a finished piece of beautiful
            summer colors almost miraculously appearing and spreading out over her small outstretched legs.
            &nbsp;Candace cocked her head and watched the creator and the creation. &nbsp;It was amazing how quickly and
            with apparent effortlessness the piece had materialized. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Have you been doing that for awhile?&rdquo; Candace asked.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Glancing up briefly, then back down at her hands, Ariadne said, &ldquo;Several
            hours.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace grinned, then cleared her throat. &nbsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said gently and
            with no condescension, &ldquo;I mean crocheting in general, not that piece specifically.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne looked up, frowning. &nbsp;Candace saw understanding find her, then Ariadne
            grinned, embarrassed, and nodded. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve crocheted
            since I was a girl.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Your mother teach you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne&rsquo;s face reddened. &nbsp;&ldquo;No, no. &nbsp;My mother never crocheted.
            &nbsp;It was Mrs. Whitstead, a neighbor across the hall from our apartment. &nbsp;I spent a lot of time with
            her in the afternoons and evenings. &nbsp;She taught me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sensing the story wasn&rsquo;t finished, Candace just waited.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Before long, Ariadne continued, almost to herself, still watching her hands as they
            twisted and turned the yarn, years of experience turning the deliberate actions into movements as smooth as
            music. &nbsp;&ldquo;She taught me to cook, too. &nbsp;We would bake scones and little cakes. &nbsp;Then we
            would make cucumber sandwiches, the cucumber sliced so thinly you could practically see through it.
            &nbsp;Then she would let me get down her china teapot and we&rsquo;d have traditional English tea. &nbsp;She
            even had cubes of sugar and tiny little tongs that you picked them up with. &nbsp;I preferred just two
            cubes, but I always took three because it was so fun to use those tongs. &nbsp;They were so delicate and
            silver. &nbsp;Real silver.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne&rsquo;s voice had trailed off as she spoke. &nbsp;Candace didn&rsquo;t
            respond, but continued to watch her. &nbsp;Finally, Ariadne looked up. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sorry.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Genuinely surprised, Candace said, &ldquo;For what?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne shrugged slightly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Blathering.&rdquo; &nbsp;She sighed, the
            sound small and almost hidden. &nbsp;Candace frowned.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you all right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne grinned slightly up at her. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, as all right as any of us
            are.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace tipped her head again. &nbsp;Ariadne had gone back to her crocheting.
            &nbsp;Candace couldn&rsquo;t imagine anyone she would be more opposite of than this small, quiet woman.
            &nbsp;Yet she found herself liking her immensely and being intrigued by her as well.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ariadne, if you don&rsquo;t mind me asking, what do &ndash; or did &ndash; you
            do for a living?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne didn&rsquo;t look up, but her hands stopped moving. &nbsp;She slowly laid the
            crochet materials down on her lap, clasping her hands together. &nbsp;Looking up at Candace, she said,
            &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a lawyer.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace Richards prided herself on being shock-proof, but that one dropped her jaw.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a ---&ldquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne&rsquo;s mouth turned up a little at the edges. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yup,&rdquo; she
            said, nodding slightly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t see that one coming, did you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace found herself laughing. &nbsp;&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am, I
            didn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne was smiling now. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh don&rsquo;t worry,&rdquo; she said.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;d never make a television show about me and my legal career. &nbsp;I do the boring
            things &ndash; business deals and contracts mostly. &nbsp;Glorified paper pusher, that&rsquo;s
            me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Narrowing her eyes, Candace examined Ariadne. &nbsp;The reporter&rsquo;s natural
            inclination to ask questions that were none of her business were coupled with this very strange situation
            where there was basically nothing to lose by being honest with and demanding honesty from each other.
            &nbsp;There was very little caution to throw to the wind.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you like that job?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne had been looking off behind Candace. &nbsp;Now she looked right at her.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Not particularly.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Then why do you do it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because it&rsquo;s what I do.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace just tipped her head and lifted her eyebrows.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne sighed again, this time more audibly. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m older than you
            are Candace. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m nearing fifty. &nbsp;My mother worked very hard as a single mom and made it
            clear she was doing so so that I would have a college education and the career not afforded her. &nbsp;It
            was always just part of &lsquo;the plan&rsquo; that I would go to law school and become a woman of power and
            means.&rdquo; &nbsp;She paused, making eye contact with Candace. &nbsp;&ldquo;We didn&rsquo;t argue with our
            mothers back then. &nbsp;It was understood what I would do, and I did it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace nodded thoughtfully. &nbsp;&ldquo;And you never married?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne grinned. &nbsp;It was absolutely contrary to her character and personality to
            talk so much about herself. &nbsp;She wondered if it was the nothing-to-lose attitude of their situation,
            but knew it was more than that. &nbsp;In this short time, these people had taken on the role of her family.
            &nbsp;She was more comfortable, right now, in this room with a woman that she would not have ever befriended
            in the &ldquo;real world,&rdquo; than she had been &hellip;. well, than she could </span><span
            class="c4">ever</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;remember being. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace noticed the sincerity in Ariadne&rsquo;s smile when she looked back up at
            her.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she finally answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;No, I&rsquo;ve never married.
            &nbsp;I had a brief &ndash; fling, I guess you&rsquo;d call it &ndash; early on in my career with one of the
            partners. &nbsp;Stupid. &nbsp;I thought I knew what love was. &nbsp;And he, of course, was divorcing his
            wife&hellip;.&rdquo; &nbsp;She laughed lightly, shaking her head. &nbsp;&ldquo;It was classic. &nbsp;There
            was no divorce, there was no love. &nbsp;There was, however, a baby.&rdquo; &nbsp;Ariadne laughed lightly
            again, dropped her head back on the chair and looked up at the ceiling. &nbsp;&ldquo;I told him about the
            pregnancy. &nbsp;Part of me thought he might want to be part of her life. &nbsp;Not only did he not want
            that, he denied it was his and threatened me with everything from job termination to lawsuits.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne looked at Candace. &nbsp;There was pain in each of their eyes.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;So,&rdquo; Ariadne said, &ldquo;I quit that firm, found another, had my baby, and became a
            single working mom.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was silence for a few moments, then Candace said, &ldquo;And your daughter?
            &nbsp;What does she do?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c21"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ariadne&rsquo;s eyes drifted again,
            the smile staying at the edges, but framing a sadness that had begun growing in her eyes. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;She&rsquo;s a clerk at a department store,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Also
            a single working mom. &nbsp;My granddaughter is just three.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You and your daughter don&rsquo;t get along, I take it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne looked up, her face puzzled.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace shifted on the couch. &nbsp;&ldquo;You said something earlier about how you
            didn&rsquo;t really talk.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne nodded, shrugged slightly. &nbsp;Fully aware that she was telling more about
            herself than she ever had before in her life, she continued. &nbsp;&ldquo;My mother had me almost out of
            defiance, an in-your-face to her mother I think, and to the world in general. &nbsp;She raised me to be this
            independent thinker. &nbsp;I bucked her system a bit by not being as hard as I think she wanted me to be.
            &nbsp;Then I had my daughter out of foolishness and misplaced emotions. &nbsp;I raised her also to be an
            independent thinker, but I also taught her, mostly without meaning to, to be afraid of her feelings.
            &nbsp;That backfired when she became a teen and saw no value in the deeper emotions. &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t
            go seeking relationship, she went seeking pleasure, what she called &lsquo;love.&rsquo; &nbsp;She had her
            daughter out of spite, more or less. &nbsp;And out of anger at the world and at me, she&rsquo;s raising her
            almost defiantly. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ve offered to help her with school. . .&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly very tired, Ariadne sighed deeply. &nbsp;She looked up at Candace who was
            still watching her. &nbsp;Ariadne tipped her head slightly and eyed Candace. &nbsp;She didn&rsquo;t look
            like a reporter. &nbsp;She looked more like a friend.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That was a mouthful,&rdquo; Ariadne grinned.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t often do that, do you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne frowned at Candace. &nbsp;&ldquo;You have a gift, you know.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Candace&rsquo;s turn to be surprised. &nbsp;Her eyes widened. &nbsp;&ldquo;A
            gift?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne clasped her hands again. &nbsp;&ldquo;I know it has a lot to do with
            our&hellip; &lsquo;situation&rsquo; here, but it also has a lot to do with you. &nbsp;I have never told
            anyone the things I just told you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace grinned and nodded. &nbsp;&ldquo;Journalism one-oh-one.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne didn&rsquo;t smile, but slowly shook her head. &nbsp;&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t
            think so. &nbsp;And I&rsquo;m not sure we could have had this conversation when we first got here.
            &nbsp;You&rsquo;re different somehow. &nbsp;Tell me something, Candace. &nbsp;Do you really </span><span
            class="c4">care</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;about me and my background?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace was shocked at the question and hesitated, taking it in. &nbsp;As a student
            of journalism, what she learned to care about was the story. &nbsp;The people were the means to the end.
            &nbsp;They were the capitalized names on the paper or the two-dimensional image on the screen. &nbsp;Jeremy
            and his family changed all that somehow. &nbsp;Realizing the silence in the room, Candace remembered
            Ariadne&rsquo;s question. &nbsp;When she suddenly knew the answer, with the revelation she felt a new kind
            of satisfaction. &nbsp;Ariadne saw it in her face and smiled.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Candace said, the truthfulness obvious. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, I do
            care.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right,&rdquo; Ariadne said, nodding once and picking her crochet hook and yarn
            back up. &nbsp;&ldquo;That, my friend, is a gift.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott found himself staring out the window. &nbsp;He had no idea how long he had
            been sitting like that. &nbsp;Frowning, mentally chastising himself, he readjusted the guitar across his
            legs, leaning forward and picking the pencil back up, tapping it on the pad of paper on the desk in front of
            him. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The song was coming along, but more slowly than he was comfortable with.
            &nbsp;Usually, words would start rolling around in his head, moving and fine-tuning within him until they
            became lyrics. &nbsp;Then, while he worked on those, a tune would start quietly, almost hauntingly, on the
            edges of his consciousness, building in tone and timbre until it reached a crescendo, the lyrics and the
            notes almost miraculously fitting together.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Considering the circumstance, it came as no shock to Elliott that this time it was
            different.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The tune was simple and already in his head. &nbsp;He had written it down on the
            blank music pages he&rsquo;d found with the other equipment in the room. &nbsp;It was an uncomplicated
            melody, almost a country sound. &nbsp;Elliott imagined it with simple guitar and piano background &ndash; a
            blending of the easy jazz, bluesy style he loved the most with the more predictable sounds of a country
            ballad. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now he was working on the words. &nbsp;Since becoming a Christian, all of
            Elliott&rsquo;s songs had God infused throughout them. &nbsp;Even if not overtly Christian, God&rsquo;s
            presence was still there. &nbsp;Rather like Elliott&rsquo;s life actually, he reasoned. &nbsp;He may not be
            a preacher or an evangelist, but he hoped God&rsquo;s presence on his life was obvious, like the key
            signature of a song to a non-musical listener. &nbsp;They may not know what the key is, but its existence in
            the song was clear, making it logical and right. &nbsp;Unsure of how to express his feelings and thoughts
            through conversation, Elliott poured himself into his music, hoping somehow to show God&rsquo;s hand on his
            life that way.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott paused in his reverie. &nbsp;God&rsquo;s hand&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sitting up straighter, he lifted his head, tipped it to one side as if straining to
            hear a whisper. &nbsp;One hand raised, a finger pointed in a silent &ldquo;wait,&rdquo; Elliott listened.
            &nbsp;After a moment, he smiled, his body relaxed. &nbsp;Elliott Paulson leaned over the pad of paper and
            started to write.</span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal was staring at Kenny Schwartz&rsquo;s mangled leg and trying to figure out what
            to do next. &nbsp;His brain felt like it was jerking in his head with the pieces of information bolting
            through it. &nbsp;No communication. &nbsp;No idea where they were. &nbsp;No medical training. &nbsp;No other
            help available. &nbsp;Hal looked around desperately and felt the tension rising in his chest like a brewing
            volcano. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He had never felt more helpless in his life.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">I don&rsquo;t know anything, he found himself thinking. &nbsp;One school-required
            course of cpr was his only medical training. He knew nothing about boats. &nbsp;He knew nothing about
            electronic equipment of the type on the boat. &nbsp;Now if their word processing program on their computer
            freezes up, I&rsquo;m their man, he thought wryly, another hot lava wave of anxiety washing through him.
            &nbsp;I am not equipped to be of help to these people.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yet, he thought, frustration peaking, here I am.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal felt as if he&rsquo;d always just found himself places. &nbsp;With no real plans
            for his education, but no real option by his parents, young Hal had found himself in college getting a
            liberal arts education with a minor in business. &nbsp;Plagued by a life-long lack of direction, Hal&rsquo;s
            first major job was writing copy for a travel company&rsquo;s brochures. &nbsp;Hoping to get some first-hand
            experience to write from, Hal was disappointed to learn that he would have to rely on research and not
            travel to describe the places he would never visit. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">From that job, Hal drew a paycheck from a series of similar positions, all of which
            evolved into working on a computer. &nbsp;Always a quick learner, Hal had adapted to the workings of a pc
            and became quite good at troubleshooting problems. &nbsp;So when his wife showed him a news article about a
            major school district hiring technicians to keep up with the demand of schools in the digital age, he took
            the necessary test, passing with high marks, and found himself a school employee.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was a horrible job. &nbsp;All day he was responding to emails and phone calls from
            teachers on his campus having issues with their technological equipment, most of which could be solved by a
            click of a mouse. &nbsp;Occasionally it got interesting and he would have the fun of diagnosing a more
            difficult issue, digging deeper to find the source of the problem. &nbsp;Even if the computer&rsquo;s
            operator didn&rsquo;t appreciate his efforts, Hal always felt especially fulfilled in those moments.
            &nbsp;He saw the problem, defined the problem, fixed the problem. &nbsp;Simple. &nbsp;That felt good.
            &nbsp;For a man who knew he had no particular skills, that felt very good.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">This, Hal thought looking around the room again, does not feel good. &nbsp;And, to
            add insult to injury, he was being looked to for help by two people whom he admired </span><span
            class="c4">for</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;their talent and skills.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Looking upward again, he silently asked, Why me? &nbsp;If the most recent
            suppositions of the four at the yellow house were true, that God Himself was placing them in these
            positions, then why would He put Hal here? &nbsp;What could he possibly do to help these people?</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bibby came rushing back into the room, grimacing when she saw her husband&rsquo;s
            exposed leg. &nbsp;When she looked at Hal, her face was pale, her eyes beyond frightened. &nbsp;But there
            was more than fear in her eyes, and it was that other message that caused Hal&rsquo;s heart to catch in his
            chest. &nbsp;When she looked at Hal it was with unmistakable trust.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Stunned, Hal froze. &nbsp;Could there be a more misplaced emotion? &nbsp;he thought.
            &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">But then, just as suddenly, and almost inexplicably, Hal felt his racing heart relax
            and his resolve turn more toward steel. &nbsp;It is what it is, he thought. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m all
            they&rsquo;ve got. &nbsp;He found himself praying that he wouldn&rsquo;t let them down. &nbsp;His own inner
            cheerleader actually voiced the charge: &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s do this thing. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Taking the sheet from Bibby, Hal touched her arm to get her to look at him.
            &nbsp;Smiling gently, he said, &ldquo;I need a clean towel. &nbsp;A smaller one, like a hand towel.
            &nbsp;Okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bibby nodded, and hurried into the adjoining bathroom.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal turned to the bed. &nbsp;There had been no reaction out of Kenny for several
            minutes. &nbsp;Hal frowned and felt the man&rsquo;s pulse. &nbsp;It was steady. &nbsp;It seemed strong, but
            who knew? &nbsp;When he turned toward the leg, Bibby was back at bedside with the towel. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Can you hold his foot up for me?&rdquo; Hal asked.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bibby nodded and stood at the foot of the bed. &nbsp;Hal, supporting the leg at the
            knee with this left hand, gently lifted Kenny&rsquo;s foot with his right, keeping the old towels on the bed
            below his leg. &nbsp;With Bibby holding up the foot, and working quickly with just his right hand, Hal
            wrapped the new towel once around the calf. &nbsp;Picking up the folded sheet from the bed, he began to
            unfold it awkwardly with one hand. &nbsp;Bibby recognized what he was doing and, carefully cradling her
            husband&rsquo;s foot in her right hand, reached over with her left to help Hal. &nbsp;Opening the sheet so
            it was still folded lengthwise, Hal slipped it under Kenny&rsquo;s leg, then he and Bibby began working
            together to wrap it gently around and around the injured calf. &nbsp;When they finished, Hal quickly swooped
            the old, bloodied towels off of the bed, then he and Bibby very gently laid the injured leg back on the
            pillows.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you have any scissors?&rdquo; Hal asked. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Without answering, Bibby turned again and went across the room. &nbsp;When she
            returned, she had a pair of shears in her hands. &nbsp;Hal used them to cut the edge off the sheet, then
            again, creating two strips of fabric that he used to carefully tie the sheet bandage onto Kenny&rsquo;s leg.
            &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal found himself amazed that an artery hadn&rsquo;t been severed. &nbsp;Kenny had no
            tourniquet on his leg. &nbsp;The bleeding was fairly steady in the too-open wound, but at least wasn&rsquo;t
            gushing. &nbsp;Hal knew he didn&rsquo;t have enough knowledge about tourniquets to attempt one now. &nbsp;It
            also didn&rsquo;t seem logical that one would be necessary at this point.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Now, he thought, I have to get them off this boat.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">His brain racing, Hal looked around.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Surprised, he looked over at Bibby who had asked the question.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; he repeated.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You look like you&rsquo;re looking for something. &nbsp;What?&rdquo; &nbsp;She
            seemed especially anxious. &nbsp;Hal felt a wave of compassion roll over him. &nbsp;This poor thing had been
            with her injured and perhaps dying husband for who knows how long before Hal got there. &nbsp;She must have
            felt the epitome of helplessness. &nbsp;Now, with Hal here, she was able to respond to requests and feel
            like she was doing something to save Kenny. &nbsp;Hal&rsquo;s eyes narrowed as he looked at her. &nbsp;Just
            getting a sheet and a pair of scissors must have been an unspeakable relief.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal reached over and gently squeezed her arm. &nbsp;Smiling, he said,
            &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve done a wonderful job. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t have any medical training, but it seems to me
            that wrapping his leg like that and elevating it was very smart. &nbsp;I think it&rsquo;s a wonder that you
            were able to get him to the bed. &nbsp;Now we&rsquo;re going to find a way to get you guys to some help,
            okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bibby&rsquo;s eyes brimmed as she nodded. &nbsp;She looked over at Kenny and frowned
            again. &nbsp;When she spoke, her voice, which Hal had heard many times powerfully booming out a tragic
            ballad, was tiny and pained. &nbsp;&ldquo;Kenny has always said his first job was to take care of me.
            &nbsp;I can imagine you received some instructions when I was out of the room, right?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal nodded, grinning. &nbsp;Bibby&rsquo;s smile was weak, but knowing. &nbsp;Looking
            back at her husband, she said, &ldquo;He thinks it&rsquo;s all about me. &nbsp;Can you imagine? &nbsp;In
            today&rsquo;s selfish world, he thinks it&rsquo;s all about me. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s made my career. &nbsp;He
        </span><span class="c4">is</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;my career, and yet he&rsquo;s told me if I ever tire of
            it, we&rsquo;ll move on and do something else. &nbsp;He&rsquo;s truly content to take a back seat &ndash; to
            let me have all the glory, so to speak.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tears had begun silently sliding down the woman&rsquo;s cheeks. &nbsp;Hal looked down
            at her hands and noticed she was tenderly caressing her husband&rsquo;s foot.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I love my career,&rdquo; she said, her voice almost inaudible.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;But you know what I love most?&rdquo; &nbsp;She glanced up at Hal who slowly shook his head.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;The best part of my life,&rdquo; she continued, her voice stronger, &ldquo;is being Mrs. Kenny
            Schwartz.&rdquo; &nbsp;Her voice cracked a little, the tears flowing faster. &nbsp;&ldquo;You see, for me,
            it&rsquo;s all about </span><span class="c4">him</span><span class="c0">.&rdquo; &nbsp;She looked up at Hal,
            her face reddening, pinching at the corners. &nbsp;Hal knew she was nearing break-down. &nbsp;&ldquo;We have
            to save him,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Please.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal nodded, gripped her arm with his hand. &nbsp;Looking her directly in the eye, he
            said, &ldquo;We will. &nbsp;I promise.&rdquo; &nbsp;And then he turned and hurried out of the room.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">A few moments later, Hal was at the back of the cruiser, frowning up at the darkening
            sky. &nbsp;That stupid storm, he thought wryly. &nbsp;Ironically, he&rsquo;d almost forgotten about it.
            &nbsp;Having done a quick search of the boat, he&rsquo;d found a few things he hoped would help make the
            impossible transfer of the couple from their boat to his little motorboat. &nbsp;Not sure Bibby was strong
            enough to help carry Kenny, and afraid to jar the injured leg any more than it already had been, Hal found a
            small, narrow cot in one of the rooms and pulled the relatively thin mattress off of it. &nbsp;Working
            together, he and Bibby had carefully lifted a still unconscious Kenny off the bed and onto the mattress.
            &nbsp;Then, half lifting and half dragging, they got him out of the bedroom and to the back of the boat
            where Hal&rsquo;s the little motorboat was still moored, bobbing in the now choppier waters. &nbsp;Hal
            frowned down at the small boat.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">How in the world was he going to get the man onto the boat without somebody ending up
            in the water?</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sighing and frowning, he looked around. &nbsp;Spotting a long-armed pole, he hurried
            to it and picked it up. &nbsp;It had a slight hook at the end. &nbsp;He looked questioningly over at Bibby,
            but she had knelt beside Kenny and was bent over him, brushing his hair back, looking closely at his still,
            pale face. &nbsp;Hal thought he heard her singing.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pausing only a moment, he went to the back of their boat. &nbsp;An opening in the
            short back &ldquo;wall&rdquo; of the boat led to a small landing of sorts, likely a diving platform.
            &nbsp;It was only about a foot deep, but came more or less even with the top of the motorboat. &nbsp;Not
            trusting himself on the platform, Hal leaned over the short wall and used the hook to grab his boat by its
            nose, still tethered to the larger boat, &ldquo;walking&rdquo; the hook down the side of the motorboat,
            pulling it in so that its long side rested against the back of the larger boat. &nbsp;That done, Hal frowned
            and looked around. &nbsp;He had to find a way to secure the back of his boat as the front was so it
            wouldn&rsquo;t drift out as they attempted to board it. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was no other rope that he could see. &nbsp;A clap of thunder, entirely too
            close by, caused him to startle and look up. &nbsp;The sky was getting darker by the minute. &nbsp;With a
            quick glance at the couple near him, Hal set his jaw and looked back at the boat he was now holding up
            against the larger craft with the metal rod. &nbsp;Working quickly, before the small boat could drift out
            away from him again, he released the hook from the side and quickly grabbed the rudder stick with it. &nbsp;
            Tugging a couple times, confident that it would hold, Hal looked around again. &nbsp;He needed duct tape.
            &nbsp;Now </span><span class="c4">that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was a tool he knew how to use.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bibby,&rdquo; he said, having to raise his voice in the growing wind.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;I need some tape. &nbsp;Like duct tape or electrical tape.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nodding, she stood and walked just a few feet to the edge of the boat and lifted the
            top of a bench seat. &nbsp;Digging around for just a moment in the storage area, she turned around, a large
            roll of the silver tape in her hand. &nbsp;Taking the few steps to Hal, she said, &ldquo;What should I
            do?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Smiling reassuringly at her, Hal said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll hold this pole down against
            the edge of the boat. &nbsp;You put several strips of that tape on it to hold it.&rdquo; &nbsp;Grateful she
            didn&rsquo;t question his planning, Hal held the pole steady while Bibby secured it with the tape.
            &nbsp;Hoping that would do it, he straightened and turned toward Kenny. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; he said, the confidence in his voice surprising even him,
            &ldquo;let&rsquo;s get you guys off this tub.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Opening the small door at the back of the boat, he said, &ldquo;You get on first,
            then just guide the mattress as I push him toward you. &nbsp;Okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bibby nodded and adeptly stepped from the back of her boat onto the motorboat.
            &nbsp;Hal was relieved to see there was barely any space between the two crafts. Stepping onto the small
            platform, Hal turned back to Kenny, bending and reaching for him, pulling him on the mattress toward the
            opening. &nbsp;Once he got his feet out, he moved slightly aside. &nbsp;Without being told, Bibby reached up
            and took the end of the mattress and began tugging lightly.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Careful!&rdquo; Hal cautioned. &nbsp;His feet planted and braced, he helped
            guide the side of the mattress as it slid slowly past him. &nbsp;When Kenny&rsquo;s shoulders reached the
            opening, Hal called, &ldquo;Okay, hold it!&rdquo; Using his legs to brace him against the back of the boat,
            he sidled up to the mattress, grabbing the corner of it with both hands.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay, now lay that down,&rdquo; he called, &ldquo;and step toward the front of
            the boat! &nbsp;We have to turn him as the mattress comes on.&rdquo; &nbsp;Bibby obeyed, Hal noting with
            appreciation how easy it was for her to move on the bobbing boat. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, grab his feet again and
            gently turn them toward you. &nbsp;Slowly now, give me time to support his head.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bibby nodded, frowning in concentration, and pulled slowly on the end of the
            mattress. &nbsp;Hal moved quickly as the end of the mattress approached the opening in the boat, getting
            himself behind it and both hands gripping its edge. &nbsp;Quickly gaining his balance, fully aware of the
            fact that he was no longer hanging on to any part of the boat, Hal took a deep breath. &nbsp;How was he
            going to step into that boat without his hands to balance him?</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hold it!&rdquo; he called suddenly, an idea striking him. &nbsp;Careful not to
            jar Kenny more than necessary, Hal slid down the back wall of the big boat, finally sitting on the platform,
            his feet over the edge of his boat, the head of Kenny&rsquo;s mattress in his lap. &nbsp;&ldquo;Okay, hold
            him steady now!&rdquo; he called as he tightened his grip, and all but jumped onto the small boat, shifting
            his hips and twisting his torso to try to keep from jarring the injured man. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal nearly cried with relief when he found himself on his small boat, the mattress in
            his lap, Kenny undisturbed. &nbsp;He looked up triumphantly at Bibby who stared at him wide-eyed. </span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Allowing himself a quick sigh of relief, he nodding once at Bibby. &nbsp;&ldquo;Can
            you release that rope?&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She reached over and expertly untied the rope securing the front of the motorboat to
            her cruiser. &nbsp;The boat immediately began drifting away from the larger vessel. &nbsp;Hal pushed against
            the motor, causing the boat to move backward, the hook sliding off the stick, but staying attached to the
            back of the bigger boat by the strips of tape. &nbsp;Quickly pulling the chord, thankful for the quick
            starting of the engine, Hal suddenly looked up frowning at Bibby.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Which way is land?&rdquo; he shouted.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bibby didn&rsquo;t even look surprised by the question. &nbsp;Pointing to her left,
            Hal&rsquo;s right, she called above the sounds of wind and engine, &ldquo;That way, I&rsquo;d say about a
            mile.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nodding, Hal pulled out the knob on the side of the engine and grabbed the stick,
            leading his little boat back to land and help. &nbsp;He hoped.</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c7"></span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Flares!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bibby looked up quickly at Hal when he yelled. &nbsp;&ldquo;What?&rdquo; she yelled
            back. &nbsp;Between the sound of the motor and the rising winds, it was very difficult to hear.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Flares!&rdquo; Hal repeated, waving his left hand in frustration.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think about shooting up some flares!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bibby was looking confused. &nbsp;It took two tries before Hal could understand her
            response: &nbsp;&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t that why you came?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal shrugged in confusion. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I shot up both flares we had just before you came. &nbsp;I thought
            that&rsquo;s how you found us.&rdquo; &nbsp;He could barely hear her voice above the noise.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Raising his eyebrows, he made his face as noncommittal as possible. &nbsp;Grateful
            for the very noise causing the communication problem, Hal averted his eyes, busied himself with the rudder.
            &nbsp;When he looked back up at Bibby, she was frowning down at Kenny, his feet in her lap. &nbsp;She seemed
            to not even remember the conversation. &nbsp;Hal noticed she was tightly gripping both sides of the motor
            boat.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He waited for her to look up at him. &nbsp;When she did, he shouted, &ldquo;Are you
            okay?&rdquo; and nodded toward her hands.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bibby nodded, her brow furrowed, her face pinched. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes! &nbsp;I just
            &ndash; Well, I only like the water when I&rsquo;m in a big boat!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal&rsquo;s eyes widened. &nbsp;Oh great, he thought. &nbsp;Three people in a tub,
            one unconscious and two afraid of the water. &nbsp;He squinted up, past Bibby. &nbsp;The hazy air and
            darkening sky made it very difficult to see the land she had assured him was there. &nbsp;Just as he thought
            he may have caught a glimpse of it, there was a simultaneous clap of thunder and split of lightening and the
            much-threatened rain exploded out of the sky.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After that, everything happened just entirely too fast.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bibby&rsquo;s face registered horror as the rain began pounding down on Kenny.
            &nbsp;It was Hal&rsquo;s turn to be horrified when he saw her unexpectedly stand up and start to move toward
            him. &nbsp;In that split second, Hal understood she was coming to Kenny to protect him from the rain.
            &nbsp;He also understood, in that same second, that she was causing the little boat to rock even more
            violently than it already had been in the choppy water.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bibby!&rdquo; he practically screamed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Sit down!&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She cut her eyes away from Kenny just long enough to register Hal&rsquo;s fear, which
            generated her own, which caused her to jerk in her movement, which caused her to overcompensate. &nbsp;Hal
            watched in a type of mortified trance as Bibby&rsquo;s arms shot out, spiraling like twin helicopters out of
            control, then suddenly she was toppling, the movement of the boat accelerating her fall. &nbsp;Hal saw her
            head hit the side of the boat just before he saw her legs fly up in the air. &nbsp;And then he
            couldn&rsquo;t see her at all.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal quickly killed the engine, afraid of the blades hitting Bibby who could very well
            be under them now. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bibby!&rdquo; he screamed, looking over the side of the boat. &nbsp;The rain,
            the near-darkness, the choppy water all made it almost impossible to see. &nbsp;Trying not to lean too far
            and capsize the boat, Hal slid the end of the mattress off his legs and to the left, moving slightly to his
            right and looking over the edge into the churning water. &nbsp;A type of panic began to build in him as he
            squinted against the rain, trying desperately to see a glimpse of Bibby. &nbsp;An almost irrational fear of
            having to tell Kenny that he&rsquo;d lost her propelled him even further over the side of the rocking
            boat.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bibby!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then he saw her. &nbsp;As if lifted by a giant rising bubble, she came to the
            surface of the water, about three feet from the side of the boat, and floating face-down.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bibby!&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal reached, the boat rocking with his movement. &nbsp;He stopped, pulled his arm
            back, looked back at Kenny being pelted by the rain but unaware of it or the drama unfolding around him.
            &nbsp; Desperate, Hal looked out at Bibby. &nbsp;Knowing it wouldn&rsquo;t be long before she drifted away
            from him even further, not knowing if she was already dead, Hal took a deep breath, gripped the side of the
            boat with his left hand, and quickly, before he could think about it, vaulted his legs up and over the side,
            dropping into the water.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal gasped with fear when he hit the water, a choking mouthful of lake water causing
            him to cough. &nbsp;Hal felt his fingers leave the edge of the boat and he scrambled, kicking his legs and
            reaching up until he once again grasped the boat. &nbsp;His instinct was to pull himself back into it, but
            he shook his head, clearing his eyes of rain and lake water, and looked desperately around for Bibby.
            &nbsp;She was drifting away from the boat. &nbsp;Hal reached out toward her, but she was just out of his
            reach. &nbsp;A cry escaped him as he, still clinging to the boat, lunged through the water toward her.
            &nbsp;His fingertips just reached her tennis shoe and he clawed desperately, pulling toward her, until he
            felt his hand move up to the top of her shoe. &nbsp;Slipping his fingertips into her shoe, he pulled, her
            body easily moving toward him in the water.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">His left hand still on the boat, Hal continued to pull Bibby&rsquo;s body toward him,
            gripping first her ankle, then her leg, until she was finally up beside him and he could slip his arm around
            her middle, turning her so her face was out of the water.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She looked dead.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal felt his stomach quake and he looked desperately around, as if he expected help
            to just appear. &nbsp;Allowing a cry of frustration to escape him, he moved quickly. &nbsp;Getting a firmer
            grip on Bibby, Hal pulled up on the boat with his left hand, causing it to list dangerously toward the
            water. &nbsp;With one swift movement, he practically flung Bibby up and over the side of the boat, grimacing
            when he heard the impact as she hit the seats inside.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was no way he could get himself back in the boat without capsizing it.
            &nbsp;Hal had calculated that they were very close to land, but the storm made it impossible to see if it
            was true. &nbsp;He had two dead or dying people in the boat, he was unable to get back into the boat, and he
            had no idea how far away land and help was.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">A desperate sob escaped him. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then Hal realized he was moving. &nbsp;The boat was being propelled forward by the
            waves and the wind. &nbsp;It was going toward land. &nbsp;And help. &nbsp;Hal&rsquo;s sob turned into a
            half-shout of joy. &nbsp;He willed the boat on, kicking his feet and trying to push it along.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he realized that his 200-plus pounds hanging off the side of the boat were not
            helping it get faster to shore. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">In a surreal, almost slow-motion way, Hal pictured Kenny and Bibby in the boat.
            &nbsp;Too low to actually see them, he imagined their bodies, battered by the rain, Bibby likely not
            breathing. &nbsp;The last things he had seen and heard from either of them was the trust that he would take
            care of the other. &nbsp;That he, Hal, would find the way out of this for them. &nbsp;That he, Hal, would
            save the day.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He knew what he had to do.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hesitating only a moment, his fingers gripping more tightly to the edge of the boat,
            Hal found himself almost chuckling from the irony.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ah well, he thought, I&rsquo;ve died once, I guess I can do it again.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">And he let go of the boat, pushing it as hard as he could, willing it to rush to
            shore and to help, watching it move away from him as he sank below the water.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott pounded down the stairs, startling Candace and Ariadne as they sat in the
            living room.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is Hal back?&rdquo; he shouted.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The women frowned, Candace&rsquo;s face registering anger. &nbsp;&ldquo;Good heavens,
            Elliott, you about scared us to&mdash;&ldquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is he back?!&rdquo; Elliott was shouting, his face red.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The women looked at each other, their faces concerned. &nbsp;Ariadne stood from the
            chair and faced the young man, breathing heavily now, his eyes fearful.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No, honey,&rdquo; she said gently. &nbsp;&ldquo;We haven&rsquo;t seen him.
            &nbsp;Elliott, what&rsquo;s wrong?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott looked around, his eyes almost wild. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know! &nbsp;I
            don&rsquo;t know! &nbsp;I just &ndash;&ldquo; &nbsp;He spun in a circle, confusion and fear in his face, his
            hands gesturing wildly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Something is wrong. &nbsp;I just feel like Hal is&hellip;. I
            don&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne and Candace both rushed up to him, each taking an arm. &nbsp;Leading him to
            the couch, they gently forced him down, each making shushing noises to calm him. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No really,&rdquo; he said, shaking his head, tears starting down his face,
            &ldquo;something is really wrong.&rdquo; &nbsp;He looked back and forth to each of them, his eyes pleading
            for understanding.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Glancing quickly at each other, both women nodded. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay,&rdquo; Ariadne said, her voice a strained calm, &ldquo;we believe you.
            &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t know what it is, and I&rsquo;m not the world&rsquo;s best at this, but there&rsquo;s
            only one thing we can do&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">And the three began to pray.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal held his breath as he felt his body sinking into the water. &nbsp;His legs
            straight, he went straight down. &nbsp;He found himself thinking of his uncle, wishing he had overcome his
            fear enough to teach Hal to swim. &nbsp;He thought about the others at the yellow house and wondered if he
            would go back to them. &nbsp;He thought of his wife and children and knew suddenly and without doubt that he
            loved them more than his own life. &nbsp;He felt his lungs begin to burn. &nbsp;He felt his arms drift up.
            &nbsp;He felt his head get dizzy.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">And then he felt ground under his feet.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a surge of adrenaline, Hal bent his legs, pushing the water up with his arms to
            allow him to crouch, then he pushed as hard as he could against the lake bottom, pointing his arms up, hands
            together, feeling his body slice the water, his head breaking through more quickly than he imagined it
            would. &nbsp;Kicking his feet, flailing his arms, trying to push the water with them, he moved forward,
            fighting to keep his head above the water, gasping for air, drinking in rain and lake water with each
            breath.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">When his hand hit something hard, he realized he had his eyes closed. &nbsp;Opening
            them, he saw the boat was there in front of him. &nbsp;Grabbing the back of it and stretching his legs out,
            he realized he could feel solid ground and began to walk, straining his legs in the water, pushing the boat
            ahead of him, the water getting shallower and shallower until he was only up to his waist. &nbsp;Standing
            straight, he hurried around to the front of the boat and, grabbing it with both hands, turned his back to
            the shore and pulled backwards, heaving the small craft up onto the sand and grass of the lake&rsquo;s
            shore. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Once he was sure it wouldn&rsquo;t drift out again, moving as quickly as he could,
            Hal reached into the boat and easily lifted out the pale, lifeless body of Bibby Coonts. &nbsp;Running a few
            steps further away from the water, Hal laid her down, felt for a pulse. &nbsp;Finding none, he laid his head
            on her chest. &nbsp;There was no movement. &nbsp;She wasn&rsquo;t breathing. &nbsp;Tipping her head back,
            Hal pinched her nose shut, forced her mouth open, put his mouth over hers, and blew in a breath.
            &nbsp;Straightening, he put his left hand at the base of her sternum, his right hand over his left, and
            pushed.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;One, two, three, four, five,&rdquo; he counted out loud.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He put his ear to her mouth. &nbsp;Nothing.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal pinched her nose shut again, breathed into her mouth again, willing his air to
            fill her lungs, to keep her alive. &nbsp;Straightening, he pushed against her chest again.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;One, two, three, four, five.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Nothing.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Breathe, pump. &nbsp;Breathe, pump. &nbsp;Breathe, pump&hellip;&hellip;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal was barely aware when someone touched his shoulder. &nbsp;But then the hand
            gripped tighter and someone else came into his line of vision. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;We got this buddy, back away!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal fell back and watched in wonder as two uniformed men leaned over Bibby. &nbsp;One
            was checking for a pulse, the other had his head on her chest checking for breathing. &nbsp;Hal was about to
            push them out of the way and begin cpr again when the man listening to her chest held up a hand.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hold it!&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Turn her over!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The two men tipped her onto her side and Hal nearly cried when he heard her coughing
            and choking, the lake water spewing out of her mouth.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">One man continued to work on her and the other turned to Hal. &nbsp;Shouting over the
            storm, squinting against the pelting rain, he said, &ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">At first Hal didn&rsquo;t understand the question. &nbsp;Then suddenly, snapped out
            of his confusion, he lifted his hand as if to wave the man away.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes! &nbsp;Her husband&rsquo;s in the boat! &nbsp;He has a bad gash to his leg
            from a boat propeller!&rdquo; &nbsp;Hal gestured wildly toward the boat, grateful when the man reacted
            quickly and ran toward the small craft.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pushing himself up, his body weak and exhausted, Hal followed him over and helped to
            lift Kenny out of the boat. &nbsp;Still unconscious, Kenny didn&rsquo;t react as the men laid him on the
            grass next to his wife whose eyes were still closed, but, Hal noticed with massive relief, whose chest was
            steadily rising and falling as she breathed on her own. &nbsp;The man who had helped carry Kenny checked him
            quickly for a pulse. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Looking up at his partner, he yelled above the noise of the rain.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s alive! &nbsp;Pulse weak. &nbsp;How&rsquo;s she?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The second man nodded, standing. &nbsp;&ldquo;She&rsquo;ll make it!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">They both ran off. &nbsp;Hal looked up and saw the ambulance, lights flashing.
            &nbsp;The men retrieved a gurney from the back and hurried back with it, quickly lifting Bibby onto it and
            strapping her in. &nbsp;Rushing her to the ambulance, they pulled a second gurney out and rushed back,
            lifting Kenny carefully and strapping him in as well.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">As one of the men pushed him hurriedly toward the ambulance, the other looked at Hal,
            laid a hand on his shoulder.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You sure you&rsquo;re okay?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We probably ought to take
            you, too. &nbsp;Get you checked out.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal shook his head. &nbsp;&ldquo;No room,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;And I&rsquo;m
            fine. &nbsp;But,&rdquo; he frowned, &ldquo;how did you know? &nbsp;How did you find us?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other ambulance worker shouted something and the man looked up, waved.
            &nbsp;Patting Hal&rsquo;s shoulder, he said, &ldquo;The flares! &nbsp;Somebody saw them from shore, then saw
            your boat coming in, and they called us. &nbsp;Are these your friends?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal smiled. &nbsp;&ldquo;Kenny Schwartz and Bibby Coonts,&rdquo; he said, noting the
            rising of the man&rsquo;s eyebrows. &nbsp;Good, Hal mused, a fellow music lover. &nbsp;&ldquo;Take care of
            them.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Right!&rdquo; the man said, hurrying now toward the waiting ambulance.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;You can get home from here?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal waved, nodded. &nbsp;The man jumped in the ambulance and Hal watched it drive
            away, siren beginning to wail.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Home. &nbsp;Hal sighed heavily. &nbsp;How </span><span class="c4">do</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;I get home from here?</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was looking around him when he felt his body begin to tingle. &nbsp;He was
            laughing as he watched his hands begin to disappear.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&nbsp;Elliott was asleep on the couch, Candace curled up on the other end, either
            asleep or close to it. &nbsp;Ariadne sat on the edge of the coffee table and watched them, her heart
            surging. &nbsp;With love, she realized with a start. &nbsp;Shaking her head in wonder, she stared at first
            one then the other. &nbsp;They had grouped together in prayer for Hal, like little soldiers protecting one
            of their own. &nbsp;The prayers had been sometimes awkward, sometimes profound, but always from the heart.
            &nbsp;Eloquence out the window, the three had just pleaded for the safety of their friend, his absence as
            painful and obvious as a missing limb. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then, just as suddenly as Elliott had burst into the room, the compulsion to pray was
            lifted, and they lapsed into an exhausted silence, the other two gradually drifting to sleep at opposite
            ends of the couch.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne stood, folding her arms across the front of her. &nbsp;Turning slowly, she
            walked toward one of the windows at the front of the house. &nbsp;Looking out across the yard, the grass
            darkening in the setting sun, she sighed and leaned against the window frame. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then she straightened suddenly, and, with a quick glance at her unmoving partners on
            the couch, hurried out of the house, closing the door as quietly as possible, before she practically jumped
            off the porch and ran across the yard.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">About fifteen yards out, Hal was in the grass, on his knees, bent over, his back to
            her. &nbsp;Ariadne ran up to him, then stopped before she reached him, unsure of how to proceed.
            &nbsp;Walking up slowly, she said, &ldquo;Hal?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal turned and looked up at her. &nbsp;Ariadne gasped when she saw his face. &nbsp;It
            was red, his eyes bloodshot and full of tears which flowed steadily down his cheeks. &nbsp;He was
            practically gasping for breath.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne&rsquo;s heart caught in her chest. &nbsp;One hand to her throat, the other
            grabbed Hal&rsquo;s shoulder. &nbsp;Dropping to her knees beside him, Ariadne said, &ldquo;Hal&hellip; What
            is it? Are you okay?&rdquo; &nbsp;She looked intently into his eyes, her own eyes tearing up in sympathy.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Hal, what&rsquo;s happened? Are you hurt?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal was shaking his head, swallowing the sobs which continued to escape him, he
            suddenly turned and wrapped Ariadne in a tight embrace. &nbsp;She thought her heart would break at the sound
            of his cries on her shoulder. &nbsp;All she could do was hold him and wait.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, his breathing slowed and Hal pushed away from her, falling back exhausted in
            the grass, stretching his legs out in front of him. &nbsp;Wiping his face with his hands, he smiled over at
            Ariadne, then leaned back on his hands in the grass. &nbsp;Thoroughly confused, she sat back on the grass as
            well, pulling her legs up in front of her and wrapping her arms around them, her chin on her knees.
            &nbsp;She just waited, watching him, her eyes portraying her worry.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal chuckled softly, shaking his head. &nbsp;&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; he said.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;And sorry about that.&rdquo; Before she could answer, he looked away, leaning back and looking
            up at the clear sky. &nbsp;&ldquo;Ariadne, I sure hoped I&rsquo;d find out what we&rsquo;re doing here.
            &nbsp;And then I thought I figured it out. &nbsp;Someone needed help and I would help them. &nbsp;Like
            Candace did. &nbsp;Deed done, bada bing, bada boom.&rdquo; &nbsp;He looked over at her, his eyes brimming
            again.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;But it wasn&rsquo;t like that. &nbsp;It was intense and it was scary and it
            was something I could do </span><span class="c4">nothing</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;about. &nbsp;It was
            two people I admired looking to me for help and me not being capable of delivering.&rdquo; &nbsp;He was
            talking faster. &nbsp;&ldquo;It was life and death and it looked like death had won and just when I thought
            it truly had, it didn&rsquo;t.&rdquo; &nbsp;His face was red with animation, his eyes bright.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Turning to face her again, his gaze intense, Hal said, &ldquo;Ariadne, I am an
            ordinary man who has lived a very ordinary life. &nbsp;And I still don&rsquo;t know what this place is,
            whether we&rsquo;re dead or not, whether this is forever or not. &nbsp;But today, by some means I may never
            understand, I looked death in the face three different ways&hellip; And I have never felt more </span><span
            class="c4">alive</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in my life.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c21"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ariadne stared in wonder as Hal
            sighed deeply, still leaning back in the grass. &nbsp;He shook his head twice, as if continuing to come to
            terms with what had happened to him. &nbsp;Then he slumped slightly and Ariadne braced herself for another
            outpouring of emotion. &nbsp;Leaning forward, prepared to help in any way she could, she suddenly frowned in
            amused curiosity as she watched Hal&rsquo;s shoulders start to shake. &nbsp;Then she smiled, shaking her
            head, as she watched the man drop his head back and laugh from the bottom of his heart. &nbsp;It was, she
            thought, the sound of freedom.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c9"></span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Hal walked into the kitchen the next morning, Elliott was already at the table,
            staring at a glass of milk in front of him.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;El? You okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott looked up, surprised to realize Hal had walked in.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sure! &nbsp;How about you, though?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal grinned and walked to the counter to start the coffee. &nbsp;He was surprised how
            strongly grateful he was to see that Candace had already prepared it. &nbsp;He simply had to click the
            switch to &ldquo;on.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Doing so, Hal then walked over to the table and sat down opposite Elliott. &nbsp;The
            four had sat up the night before, eagerly sharing the story of Hal&rsquo;s &ldquo;adventures.&rdquo;
            &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Just exhausted,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re up
            early.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott nodded almost absently. &nbsp;&ldquo;Just finished the song.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal sat up straighter. &nbsp;&ldquo;Elliott! &nbsp;That&rsquo;s great!
            &nbsp;Congratulations!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott nodded again, only glancing up slightly.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Frowning over at him, Hal tipped his head. &nbsp;&ldquo;What is it,
            man?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott bit his lower lip, slid down in the chair. &nbsp;Looking up across the table
            at Hal, he frowned. &nbsp;&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I thought I&rsquo;d be all
            excited when I finished the song, but it feels more. . . more. . .&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Anticlimactic?&rdquo; &nbsp;Hal offered.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Twisting his mouth to one side and raising his eyebrows, Elliott considered the word.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;I guess so,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo; &nbsp;He chuckled.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;I know when I started it I felt like as soon as it was finished I&rsquo;d go buzzing out of
            here to perform it. &nbsp;I was so sure of that. &nbsp;Now&hellip; Well now I&rsquo;m not so sure about
            anything. &nbsp; You know?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do I ever,&rdquo; Hal said, not smiling. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do you ever what?&rdquo; It was Candace walking into the kitchen, looking like
            a teenager with her hair pulled back into a ponytail.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Morning!&rdquo; Hal said, standing to retrieve coffee cups for the two of
            them. &nbsp;&ldquo;Do I ever understand that I don&rsquo;t understand,&rdquo; he finished, answering her
            question.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace grinned and nodded. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh well, that makes sense. &nbsp;Morning,
            Elliott. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re up early.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;He finished his song,&rdquo; Hal said, setting a steaming cup in front of
            her.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Smiling her thanks at Hal, she looked toward Elliott. &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s
            great! &nbsp;Do we get to hear it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott shrugged, took a swallow of the milk. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hear what?&rdquo; asked Ariadne as she walked into the kitchen, her eyes
            sweeping the room. &nbsp;&ldquo;Who wants eggs?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elliott&rsquo;s song,&rdquo; Candace answered as three hands went up to answer
            the second question.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey! &nbsp;You finished it?&rdquo; &nbsp;Ariadne pulled a skillet out of the
            cabinet and put it on the stove. &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s great!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne glanced at Hal when Elliott didn&rsquo;t react. &nbsp;Hal gave a
            conspiratorial wink, then said, &ldquo;Elliott&rsquo;s not so sure it&rsquo;s a good thing.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Candace.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott shook his head. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that it&rsquo;s not a good thing,
            it&rsquo;s just that I was so sure about what I was doing when I started it and now I&rsquo;m not so sure
            any more. &nbsp;I mean, if it was the way I thought it would be before, then I would already be on my way to
            that little bar to perform this baby.&rdquo; &nbsp;Elliott patted the pocket of his jeans. &nbsp;They could
            hear the sound of paper crinkling.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pulling the carton of eggs out of the refrigerator, Ariadne said, &ldquo;Well, you
            knew you had to finish it and you have. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t worry about the rest.&rdquo; &nbsp;She deftly
            stacked the butter plate and a bottle of cream on top of the egg carton and headed back to the stove.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott squinted at her, considering her words. &nbsp;&ldquo;I guess you&rsquo;re
            right,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;And besides, if anyone&rsquo;s buzzing out of here, it&rsquo;s
            you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the stove, Ariadne turned, surprised, an egg in each hand. &nbsp;&ldquo;What do
            you mean?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott shrugged. &nbsp;&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve all had our turn. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s your
            turn now. &nbsp;Your turn to do something or learn something or try something or. . . or
            something.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne continued to stand, the eggs in her hands, frowning at Elliott.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Hm,&rdquo; she said finally, turning back to the stove.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace raised an eyebrow. &nbsp;&ldquo;What does &lsquo;hm&rsquo; mean?&rdquo; she
            asked.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne busied herself breaking eggs into a bowl.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Not discouraged, Candace said, &ldquo;Was that a thoughtful &lsquo;hm,&rsquo; or an
            &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got a secret hm,&rsquo; or an &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t want to talk about it
            hm&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal raised his eyebrows. &nbsp;&ldquo;Once a reporter. . . &ldquo; he said, allowing
            the finish to be left unspoken. &nbsp;Candace stuck her tongue out at him, then turned back to Ariadne who
            hadn&rsquo;t looked away from the skillet where she was gently stirring the eggs.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">When Ariadne still didn&rsquo;t respond, the three at the table looked at each other
            questioningly and shrugged. &nbsp;Elliott pushed himself back up in the chair.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, Ariadne,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we were just kidding.&rdquo; Even as he
            said it, he wasn&rsquo;t sure what he was apologizing for.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne didn&rsquo;t respond at first or even turn around. &nbsp;Candace frowned,
            then stood. &nbsp;&ldquo;How about I make the toast?&rdquo; she said, walking to the counter where the
            breadbox was, sneaking a sideways glance at Ariadne. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey,&rdquo; she said lightly, &ldquo;I
            didn&rsquo;t tick you off, did I?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne looked over at her, her eyes softening. &nbsp;&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said,
            &ldquo;of course not.&rdquo; &nbsp;She slid the skillet off the burner and pulled plates out of the cabinet
            as Candace dropped four pieces of bread into the toaster. &nbsp;The guys stood and retrieved plates and
            forks, butter and jelly, juice and coffee and milk. &nbsp;In moments, the four were around the table
            together, enjoying breakfast.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne sat, fork in hand, and looked around the table. &nbsp;The others looked up at
            her and stopped eating.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You okay?&rdquo; Hal asked.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne grinned and shook her head. &nbsp;&ldquo;This is it,&rdquo; she said to the
            confused frowns of the others. &nbsp;Waving the fork at them, she repeated, &ldquo;This is it!&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, Candace said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry, honey, but this is what?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne sighed, sat back in her chair, the fork clanking against the side of her
            plate as her hand dropped onto the table. &nbsp;&ldquo;I think I&rsquo;m kind of afraid to &lsquo;buzz
            out&rsquo; as Elliott says. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m not very brave and I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;d be expected
            to do. &nbsp;But I also think that when we got here, I was already. . . well, buzzed. &nbsp;You
            know?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The question was met with three wide-eyed stares and the slow shaking of heads.
            &nbsp;Ariadne laughed. &nbsp;&ldquo;You guys,&rdquo; she said, waving her hand again. &nbsp;&ldquo;I think
            the whole thing has been you guys.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other three looked at each other, then back at Ariadne, their confusion
            obvious.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sighing, Ariadne finally laid down the fork and took a long swallow of juice.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m a lawyer for goodness sake. &nbsp;You think I could come up with words a little
            better.&rdquo; &nbsp;Clearing her throat, she looked around the table. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never been
            part of a family,&rdquo; she said, her voice strong. &nbsp;&ldquo;I never had one growing up, and I
            didn&rsquo;t provide one for my daughter while she was growing up. &nbsp;The important thing was always the
            stuff &ndash; the job, the obligations, the money. &nbsp;My mother didn&rsquo;t have time for me, and I
            didn&rsquo;t know I was supposed to have time for my daughter.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The others were surprised to see tears forming in Ariadne&rsquo;s eyes.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;I never knew what I was missing. . . until now.&rdquo; &nbsp;Her voice cracked on the last word
            and eyes welled up around the table.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Swallowing, Ariadne looked down at her plate, the motion causing a tear to start
            sliding down her cheek. &nbsp;&ldquo;I love you guys like you were my natural family,&rdquo; she said, her
            voice small, still looking down at her plate. &nbsp;&ldquo;Actually, I&rsquo;ve loved you more than my
            natural family.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">She looked up, not wiping the tears still on her cheeks. &nbsp;&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t
            help but think that all this was just for that, at least for me. &nbsp;Only &ndash;&ldquo; Her face reddened
            and the tears flowed more freely. &nbsp;&ldquo;Only, what good is it? &nbsp;I mean, what good are any of
            these things we&rsquo;ve learned about ourselves?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was silence in the room as the question hung in the air.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I thought about that, too,&rdquo; Candace said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, I finally
            give up control and so what?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal nodded, his face serious. &nbsp;&ldquo;I learned how to live just in time to. . .
            to what?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott laid his hand on the pocket holding his newly-written song. &nbsp;&ldquo;And
            I wrote a song. . . for an audience of three.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was silence around the table as the four looked down at their plates or cups,
            brows furrowing in thoughtfulness. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">It was Hal who finally spoke.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So was it worth it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">All heads lifted and looked at him. &nbsp;He waited a moment, then repeated the
            question. &nbsp;&ldquo;If this is all there is. . . If we never move from here. &nbsp;Was it worth
            it?&rdquo; He looked around the circle, meeting their eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The four looked around the table at each other, reading faces, assessing feelings.
            &nbsp;Almost simultaneously, expressions lightened and eyes brightened. &nbsp;Elliott was the first to
            answer.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yep!&rdquo; he said cheerfully.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace nodded, smiling and picking up her coffee. &nbsp;&ldquo;Oh yeah,&rdquo; she
            said.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Absolutely,&rdquo; Ariadne added.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; Hal finished.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">They all sat, grinning at each other for a moment. &nbsp;Then Ariadne picked up her
            glass of juice and held it above the center of the table. &nbsp;&ldquo;To family,&rdquo; she said.
            &nbsp;Immediately the others picked up on the toast and one glass and two coffee cups were lifted to touch
            hers.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;To family!&rdquo; the three repeated.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s when Elliott&rsquo;s glass crashed to the table and he
            disappeared.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He knew this bathroom. &nbsp;He was back in the bar. &nbsp;Gerda&rsquo;s.
            &nbsp;Elliott looked at himself in the mirror. &nbsp;He looked just like he had last time. &nbsp;Or was this
            last time? &nbsp;Closing his eyes and shaking his head, he suddenly started and plowed his hand in his
            jean&rsquo;s pocket. &nbsp;The song was there. &nbsp;Sighing with relief, Elliott looked eagerly back at his
            reflection in the mirror. &nbsp;This face registered eager determination.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is your chance, boy,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t blow it
            this time!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c21"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When he walked out of the bathroom,
            Gerda, her red hair shining under the light above the bar, put her fist on her hip. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well there
            you are,&rdquo; she practically shouted. &nbsp;&ldquo;We thought we were going to have to call
            9-1-1.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott grinned and waved. &nbsp;Walking toward her, he said, &ldquo;Sorry!
            &nbsp;Mother Nature called.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well, come on,&rdquo; Gerda called, waving him to the front where the stage
            was. &nbsp;&ldquo;Things sure ain&rsquo;t picking up in here. &nbsp;We need a song.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott swallowed as he walked to the stage, wiping his damp hands on his jeans, then
            through his hair, then on his jeans again. &nbsp;Nodding at Gerda as he passed her, he stepped onto the
            stage platform and picked up the acoustic guitar waiting in the stand. &nbsp;Sitting on a high stool,
            bending his right leg and hooking his heal on the cross rung of the stool, Elliott strummed the guitar,
            checking for tuning. &nbsp;He turned a knob, strummed again. &nbsp;Tipping his head slightly, he tuned
            another knob and strummed. Nodding to himself, satisfied with the sound, he began picking and strumming,
            finding his key, enjoying the feel and tone of the guitar as the sound of a bluesy country ballad filled the
            small room.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He was in his element. &nbsp;It felt unspeakably good. &nbsp;A type of euphoria began
            to build in him as Elliott closed his eyes and continued to play the guitar, his head tipping slightly
            sideways in appreciation of the sound. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He may as well have been playing Madison Square Garden. &nbsp;It can&rsquo;t get
            better than this, he thought. &nbsp;He felt an inexplicable sense of completeness. &nbsp;He almost laughed
            when he realized he hadn&rsquo;t even begun singing his song.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Smiling, he looked up at the room, at the audience not much larger than the one
            he&rsquo;d just left at the yellow house. &nbsp;He wondered if he should have taken the song out of his
            pocket. &nbsp;No. &nbsp;He knew it very well. &nbsp;Changing the strumming, Elliott leaned toward the
            microphone and began to sing.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;</span><span class="c11">The hand of God is made of human fingers</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c11">The hand of God is made of human skin</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c11">It&rsquo;s the hand of God that grips the one that&rsquo;s outside</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c11">And gently pulls, encouraging him in. . .</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott glanced down at the guitar, strummed a short interlude, lifted his head to
            continue. . . and froze. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Walking past the window of Gerda&rsquo;s was the man Elliott had seen outside the
            Handy Dandy. &nbsp;The man who had been running from the tornado. &nbsp;The man who was killed by the car at
            the doors of the store.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott jumped up, the stool crashing loudly backwards. &nbsp;Dropping the guitar on
            the stage floor, Elliott bolted for the door.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not again,&rdquo; Gerda said, shaking her head and waving her hand
            dismissively. &nbsp;She turned back to the bar, calling over her shoulder, &ldquo;Guess that&rsquo;s it for
            the afternoon entertainment! &nbsp;And he was just getting good.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott practically fell out of the door onto the sidewalk. &nbsp;The man had passed
            the bar and hadn&rsquo;t noticed him. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; Elliott called, running after the man. &nbsp;&ldquo;Hey, sir!
            &nbsp;Hey!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Finally, the man looked over his shoulder, slowing and stopping when he realized
            Elliott was yelling after him. &nbsp;He looked a little worried and Elliott tried to relax his face.
            &nbsp;He must look like a mad man.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott caught up with the waiting man, forced himself to slow his breathing, forced
            himself to smile.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he realized he had no idea how to proceed. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">What was he supposed to say? &nbsp;The guy would surely write him off as a nut case
            at best, call for help at the worst.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The guy was beginning to look a little annoyed. &nbsp;Elliott knew he had to hurry.
            &nbsp;He also knew he had nothing to lose.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Taking a deep breath, he looked intently into the man&rsquo;s eyes and said,
            &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know me and you&rsquo;re going to think I&rsquo;m crazy, but if you believe in
            anything outside of this life and this world at all, then you need to listen.&rdquo; Elliott talked fast,
            knowing the guy could run at any moment. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re going to go to the Handy Dandy Grocery in
            Pascal this afternoon.&rdquo; &nbsp;It registered with Elliott that the man&rsquo;s eyes widened with
            surprise. &nbsp;&ldquo;And all I can say is don&rsquo;t.&rdquo; &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man frowned.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go,&rdquo; Elliott said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Because&hellip; Well,
            because&hellip;.&rdquo; Elliott frowned, bit his lip. &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t ruin it now, he chastised
            himself.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he said finally, his face softening and leaning slightly in
            toward the man whose face was an unreadable mixture of emotions, &ldquo;I know it sounds nuts, but I believe
            God wants me to tell you not to go there today. &nbsp;I think it could mean your life.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott couldn&rsquo;t read the man&rsquo;s expression, but was shocked to see his
            eyes tear up. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Seriously?&rdquo; the man said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I mean, you seriously feel like
            God wanted you to tell me that? That&rsquo;s kind of strange, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Mister,&rdquo; Elliott said, &ldquo;you have absolutely no idea.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man grinned crookedly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well then, try this one on for size. &nbsp;I
            was just praying as I walked that God would give me some kind of direction. &nbsp;I was begging him to tell
            me what to do with my life.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott&rsquo;s mouth dropped open. &nbsp;&ldquo;Whoa,&rdquo; he breathed.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yeah,&rdquo; the man said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Whoa.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott opened his mouth, eager to tell this stranger of all that had transpired.
            &nbsp;But then he felt his hands and feet begin to tingle. &nbsp;He sighed and looked around. &nbsp;I feel
            like Superman looking for a phone booth, he mused.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he said to the man, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d love to talk about this.
            &nbsp;I mean, like you can&rsquo;t believe, I&rsquo;d like to talk about this, but I really have to run.
            &nbsp;Maybe we&rsquo;ll run into each other again. . . Just not at the Handy Dandy this
            afternoon.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man&rsquo;s eyes were wide. &nbsp;&ldquo;But &ndash;&ldquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott was tingling in earnest now and turned to walk quickly away down a nearby
            alley. &nbsp;&ldquo;You have a good day!&rdquo; he called, breaking into a trot, his tingling legs
            unsteady.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;God bless you!&rdquo; the man called, waving.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh yeah!&rdquo; Elliott called without turning around.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then he began to laugh.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It was the guy!&rdquo; &nbsp;Elliott burst into the room yelling, eliciting
            small screams from Candace and Ariadne. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elliott, you have a way of stopping my heart,&rdquo; Candace grumbled,
            brushing at the front of her sweater where she had just splashed iced tea.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What guy?&rdquo; Ariadne and Hal said together, jumping up to face him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott practically ran into the living room. &nbsp;&ldquo;The guy from the store!
            &nbsp;The one that got killed at the doors! &nbsp;I saw him! &nbsp;I was singing on the stage and the guy
            was walking past the windows and I went running out and I told him not to go to the store and he really
            listened to me and I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;ll go!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was stunned and amused silence as Elliott finally took a breath.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So it wasn&rsquo;t the song!&rdquo; he said, laughing. &nbsp;&ldquo;It
            wasn&rsquo;t the song! &nbsp;I had to be </span><span class="c4">prepared</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for
            the song so I&rsquo;d see the guy as he walked by so I could warn him. &nbsp;But it wasn&rsquo;t the song at
            all!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The others looked at each other as they slowly settled back onto the chairs and
            couch, Elliott joining them at his usual end of the couch. &nbsp;As he sat, the last of the adrenaline
            seeped out of his body and a fatigue washed over him, followed by an obvious sorrow. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elliott?&rdquo; Candace said softly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Are you okay?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott nodded, not looking at her. &nbsp;His face reddened.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;El?&rdquo; Hal said, looking worriedly at the women when Elliott didn&rsquo;t
            look up.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne was staring at Elliott. &nbsp;She slowly stood and walked over to him.
            &nbsp;Kneeling on the floor next to the couch, she laid a hand on Elliott&rsquo;s arm. &nbsp;He continued to
            stare at his feet.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Honey,&rdquo; Ariadne said softly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Can we hear the
            song?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott frowned sympathetically at her. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s okay,&rdquo; he said.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m okay. &nbsp;It&rsquo;s just&hellip; Well, I thought it was the song.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne looked up at him, her eyes probing. &nbsp;&ldquo;Elliott, God put you back
            there to save that man&rsquo;s life, but. . . Well, I think </span><span class="c4">here</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;has always been about the song. &nbsp;Please, honey&hellip;. Can we hear it? We&rsquo;ve
            all been waiting for it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were mumbles of agreement from the others. &nbsp;Ariadne stood and retrieved
            the guitar from the corner where Elliott had left it propped up. &nbsp;Walking back to him, she stood in
            front of him and held it out. &nbsp;Elliott stared at it a moment, then looked up at Ariadne. &nbsp;She
            smiled at him, nodding.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Slowly, Elliott took the guitar, pushed himself forward on the couch cushion, the
            guitar easily fitting across his knee, his hands finding the frets and strings easily and naturally.
            &nbsp;He glanced up at Hal who nodded, his eyes serious, supportive, even eager. &nbsp;A quick glance at
            Candace showed him almost the exact same expression. &nbsp;Ariadne backed up to her chair and sat, her eyes
            never leaving Elliott.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Closing his eyes, Elliott began to strum, began to hum, then began to sing.</span>

    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was silence in the room as the last of the sounds of the guitar faded. &nbsp;It
            was Candace who spoke first, her voice hushed, awed.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That was. . . perfect.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">After a moment, Hal echoed: &nbsp;&ldquo;Perfect.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott grinned, not looking at them.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Elliott?&rdquo; Ariadne said, causing him to lift his eyes to her.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you. &nbsp;And believe me, it </span><span class="c4">was</span><span
            class="c0">&nbsp;the song.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Elliott&rsquo;s eyes brimmed and he nodded. &nbsp;Standing slowly, still holding the
            guitar up against him, he said, &ldquo;Thanks guys. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m really exhausted. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m going
            to get some sleep. &nbsp;I&rsquo;ll see you in the morning.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There were murmurs of good night wishes, and the three watched Elliott as he slowly
            left the room and climbed the stairs.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You think he&rsquo;s okay?&rdquo; Candace asked.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other two nodded slightly. &nbsp;&ldquo;That was quite an ordeal,&rdquo; Ariadne
            said. &nbsp;&ldquo;He&rsquo;s been this whole time here working up just for that moment. &nbsp;And now
            it&rsquo;s past. &nbsp;No wonder he&rsquo;s exhausted. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m exhausted </span><span
            class="c4">for</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;him!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal was frowning. &nbsp;&ldquo;Wow,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;The same guy from
            the store. . . You know what that made me think of?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other two shook their heads. &nbsp;&ldquo;Those guys from the deli in the store
            that day. &nbsp;I wish I could warn them. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t see how they could have
            survived.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace was nodding thoughtfully. &nbsp;&ldquo;That mother and her children,&rdquo;
            she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve often wondered if they made it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne had tears in her eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;That older couple. . . Oh!&rdquo; she
            exclaimed, shaking her head, tears in her eyes. &nbsp;&ldquo;I can barely stand to think of it
            now!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was silence for several minutes. &nbsp;When Hal spoke, his voice was choked.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;You know what?&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;Each of us would handle it differently now.
            &nbsp;None of us is the same.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Thank God,&rdquo; Candace murmured, shaking her head.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne chuckled. &nbsp;&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;&ldquo;We all had a ways
            to go, didn&rsquo;t we.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal laughed and slapped his hands down on his knees. &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the
            truth!&rdquo; he agreed. &nbsp;&ldquo;Makes me wonder what happens from here!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne&rsquo;s voice had a frightened edge to it when she said, &ldquo;Hey, is this
            what your hands looked like when you. . . &ldquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The other two looked at her and the hand she was holding up in front of her which was
            becoming translucent. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh boy!&rdquo; Candace said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I guess it&rsquo;s your &ndash;
            hey!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace held up her hands which were also disappearing.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The women looked, almost in a panic, at Hal who was looking at his own vanishing
            hands. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh boy,&rdquo; was all he managed before the three of them faded from
            sight.</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The roaring noise was getting louder. &nbsp;Hal looked around desperately, tried to
            get his bearings. &nbsp;Above him he could hear what sounded like a freight train. &nbsp;To his right was a
            deli counter.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">A deli counter.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal frowned, shook his head. &nbsp;Where--?</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then it hit him and he took off running, bursting through the swinging deli doors,
            shouting warnings as he ran.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace&rsquo;s gasp was almost a scream, the shock of finding herself back in the
            Handy Dandy so sudden as to be almost unbearable. What in the world&hellip;.. she thought, her head
            spinning. &nbsp;Catching movement out of the corner of her eye, she looked over to see a young mother
            scooping up her two small children and beginning to run. &nbsp;Her heart in her throat, Candace screamed at
            her.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Wait! &nbsp;This way!&rdquo; She intercepted the trio and pulled them back the
            other direction.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne stood, stunned into immobility and the realization of where she was almost
            too slowly dawned on her. &nbsp;Her mouth open, she stared around her, the roar above her and around her
            growing in intensity. &nbsp;When she saw the senior couple, tightly gripped in each others&rsquo; arms,
            moving around one of the aisles, she snapped out of her shock and ran toward them.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No!&rdquo; she screamed, startling the pair. &nbsp;&ldquo;Come this
            way!&rdquo; </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne grabbed the man&rsquo;s arm and steered the two of them away from the
            shelves.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Within moments, the roar had passed and an eerie silence descended over the little
            store. &nbsp;Sounds of people moving began to be heard, interspersed with cries and whimpers, and then
            screams.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal shook his head and stood up, dust from crumpled cinderblock wafting off of him.
            &nbsp;Looking around, he saw the white-frocked men from the deli stand and brush themselves off, their faces
            stunned and dusted white. &nbsp;They looked at Hal, their eyes still glazed with shock.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">With a start, Hal remembered the others and took off running.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Ariadne!&rdquo; he called. &nbsp;&ldquo;Candace! &nbsp;Elliott!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hal?&rdquo; It was Candace walking toward him, wobbling slightly in her heeled
            shoes, her hair dusted with debris, her dress wet. &nbsp;She fell into his arms, sobbing. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal held her, then held out one arm eagerly when he saw Ariadne approaching.
            &nbsp;When she got to them, the three just held each other, crying and laughing.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then they stopped suddenly. &nbsp;&ldquo;Elliott!&rdquo; they said together, and
            turned to hurry toward what had been the front of the store.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The wall had fallen inward, one-fourth of the roof of the store gone, the sky
            strangely blue and the air strangely still. &nbsp;People were still finding their footing, walking slowly
            and looking around. &nbsp;Hal thought the scene looked like war photos after a bombing. &nbsp;The three
            jerked their heads from side to side, looking for Elliott.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;El!&rdquo; Hal called. &nbsp;&ldquo;Elliott?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Has anyone seen Elliott?&rdquo; Candace was asking everyone she saw.
            &nbsp;They didn&rsquo;t appear to know what she was saying.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Suddenly there was a noise from Ariadne. &nbsp;When the two looked at her, they both
            lunged toward her, afraid she was about to faint. &nbsp;Her face was chalk white, her eyes wide.
            &nbsp;Without acknowledging them, she simply walked slowly forward, toward the rubble from the roof piled on
            the floor.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal and Candace, confused, followed her.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s when they saw the feet sticking out of the rubble and they recognized
            the all-too-familiar tennis shoes of Elliott Paulson.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No!&rdquo; Candace screamed and fell after Hal who was already heaving metal
            and stone and boxes off of Elliott and trying not to think about the fact that his legs were not
            moving.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The three tore through the rubble as fast as they could, gasping and crying, more and
            more of Elliott&rsquo;s body visible as they dug until they could see all of him. &nbsp;They stopped at
            exactly the same moment, their breathing labored, and stared at Elliott&rsquo;s still body. &nbsp;No one in
            that condition could be alive.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hal?&rdquo; Candace&rsquo;s voice was tiny.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Tears streaming down his face, Hal just stared at Elliott&rsquo;s lifeless body.
            &nbsp;Slowly shaking his head, he fell to his knees next to Elliott. &nbsp;&ldquo;No. . .&rdquo; was all he
            could manage.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne slowly walked around to Elliott&rsquo;s head, her feet slipping on the
            debris. &nbsp;Ignoring everything around her, she lowered herself to the littered ground, gently lifting
            Elliott&rsquo;s head and sliding her legs under him, cradling him against her. &nbsp;Tears streamed steadily
            down her face.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;No. . .&rdquo; she echoed Hal. &nbsp;&ldquo;It wasn&rsquo;t supposed to happen
            like this. &nbsp;Not Elliott&hellip;.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace found herself falling over Elliott, her head on his chest, her sobs tearing
            at her own chest. </span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal still knelt, stunned almost beyond all feeling.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; A voice behind them yelled. &nbsp;&ldquo;Let me through!
            &nbsp;Hey!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">An extremely bright light suddenly violated the scene and Hal looked over his
            shoulder, still too stunned to react. &nbsp;A man with a large news camera on his shoulder was pushing his
            way through the crowd around the foursome, the light practically blinding Hal as he stared at him.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Candace?&rdquo; The cameraman looked around the camera, his face registering
            shock. &nbsp;&ldquo;Candace Richards?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace looked up, frowning.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Candace, it&rsquo;s Richie! &nbsp;Hey &ndash; I was just driving by when I saw
            the twister hit and I grabbed my camera. &nbsp;Candace! &nbsp;Come on, they&rsquo;re going to go live in a
            minute with voice-over from the studio. &nbsp;But now you&rsquo;re here! &nbsp;Hey, let me get you a
            mike!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The light went off and the man ran awkwardly away from them. &nbsp;Candace looked at
            Ariadne and Hal, her face streaked with tears.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal glanced down at Elliott, then back up at Candace.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Do him proud,&rdquo; he said simply. &nbsp;Then he slowly leaned forward,
            brushing Elliott&rsquo;s hair away from his face, tears flowing as he smiled at the still young man.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to miss you, pal,&rdquo; he said simply, then stood and held
            his hand out to Ariadne. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne looked up at him, her eyes glazed, her shoulders slumped. &nbsp;She looked at
            his hand, then back down at Elliott. &nbsp;Leaning over him, she kissed her lips to his forehead, letting
            the kiss linger for a long moment.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; she whispered. &nbsp;Then she slowly lowered his head to
            the floor and allowed Hal to help her up.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace looked up at the two of them, then back down at Elliott.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a kook, Elliott Paulson,&rdquo; she said quietly. &nbsp;&ldquo;A weird, annoying,
            wonderful, beautiful kook.&rdquo; &nbsp;She kissed his cheek. &nbsp;As she pushed herself up to stand, her
            hand brushed his jeans pocket and she felt the folded paper in it. &nbsp;Pulling it carefully out, she
            unfolded it and held it out toward the other two.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;The Hand of God&rdquo; it read, the notes drawn by Elliott&rsquo;s hand, the
            words written in neat script under the lines of music.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace straightened, brushing herself off, and looked at Hal and Ariadne. &nbsp;The
            three didn&rsquo;t speak, but let eye contact linger for a moment. &nbsp;It was a moment almost of suspended
            reality, the three standing over the fourth, the world around them as strangely nonexistent as it had been
            while they&rsquo;d been in the yellow house.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then the sound of heavy running feet broke the reverie and Candace turned to see
            Richie, breathless, shoving a microphone and earpiece in her hand and backing away, the camera and the light
            clicking on, Richie nodding, confident that Candace would. . . be Candace.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Placing the earpiece, Candace heard her producer. &nbsp;&ldquo;Candace! I can&rsquo;t
            believe you&rsquo;re there! &nbsp;We go live in 10!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace wasn&rsquo;t even nervous. &nbsp;She cleared her throat, secured her stance,
            and faced the camera. &nbsp;In her ear, she heard the countdown and saw the red light come on above
            Richie&rsquo;s head.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;This is Candace Richards,&rdquo; she said, her voice even.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;m at the scene of a devastating tornado in Pascal, Texas. &nbsp;I was actually in the
            store when the tornado hit and to be honest, I have no idea of the extent of damage or injuries.&rdquo;
            &nbsp;She looked down at Elliott, her eyes filling. &nbsp;When she saw the camera begin to tip down, her
            hand shot out. &nbsp;&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you dare,&rdquo; she said, her tone causing Richie to lift the
            camera up again without filming Elliott.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I do know this,&rdquo; Candace said. &nbsp;&ldquo;I know that life can change
            in a moment and that there&rsquo;s no easy way to be ready for that.&rdquo; &nbsp;Sirens could be heard
            approaching in the distance.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I also know that this tornado silenced a voice way too soon. &nbsp;At my feet,
            right now,&rdquo; Candace&rsquo;s voice cracked and the mike trembled slightly in her hand, &ldquo;is the
            body of a young man named Elliott Paulson. &nbsp;He was a singer and songwriter who had important things to
            say and who will now not have the chance to say them.&rdquo; &nbsp;Candace held the paper up.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;He had this song in his pocket. &nbsp;A song about brotherhood and God and caring about people.
            &nbsp;It is an important song, an important message for all of us. &nbsp;Now we&rsquo;re left to wonder who
            will sing it.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace&rsquo;s voice trailed off. &nbsp;She looked confused for just a moment,
            glancing around as if she suddenly wasn&rsquo;t sure where she was. &nbsp;The sounds of the sirens were upon
            them now and she looked off toward them. &nbsp;When she did, she caught sight of an older couple trying to
            negotiate the debris on the floor. &nbsp;Gesturing toward Richie, she moved toward the couple and called out
            to them.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Sir! &nbsp;You were in the store when the tornado hit?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The man nodded, his eyes glazed from shock. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes! My wife and I were
            looking for a place to hide when a woman pulled us to safety.&rdquo; The man looked around.
            &ldquo;That&rsquo;s her there.&rdquo; &nbsp;He pointed to a middle-aged woman with waist-length hair wearing
            a long skirt.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Miss!&rdquo; Candace called, causing the woman to turn her way.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Miss, this man says you saved his life. What is your name, ma&rsquo;am?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The woman looked thoroughly stunned. &nbsp;Candace thought she looked a bit like a
            left-over flower child.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Ariadne Greene,&rdquo; the woman answered. &nbsp;&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t
            remember. . . &ldquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c21"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A large man of about forty was
            trying to get out of the way. &nbsp;Candace turned to him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Sir? &nbsp;What did you see?&rdquo;
            &nbsp;When he turned toward her, she said, &ldquo;What is your name?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hal Nixon,&rdquo; he said, wishing the woman hadn&rsquo;t noticed him.
            &nbsp;Reporters could be so annoying. &nbsp;Although this one seemed genuinely concerned about the people
            she was talking to. &nbsp;&ldquo;I just want to get home to my family,&rdquo; he added, gently but
            firmly.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The reporter smiled and stepped out of the way. &nbsp;Turning back to the camera, her
            producer telling her in her ear to wrap it up with a promise to follow up, she said, &ldquo;There you have
            it. &nbsp;Chaos, turmoil, tragedy, yet basic human goodness prevails. &nbsp;A woman saves a couple but wants
            no accolades. &nbsp;A man simply wants to see his family. &nbsp;Even in the midst of unspeakable destruction
            and,&rdquo; she glanced at the body of the young man on the floor. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d have to find out more
            about him before the next report. &nbsp;Looking back up at the camera, she finished, &ldquo;death, life goes
            on. &nbsp;This is Candace Richards reporting live from Pascal, Texas.&rdquo;</span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bibby Coonts leaned over the side of Kenny&rsquo;s hospital bed to push the tv volume
            knob up. &nbsp;Careful not to disturb her sleeping husband, she leaned toward the speaker built into the
            side of the bed. &nbsp;Glancing at Kenny, she smiled. &nbsp;Surgery had successfully saved his leg and, in
            deference to her fame, no doubt, she was allowed to share a room with him as she recovered from her
            concussion and near-drowning. &nbsp;Brushing Kenny&rsquo;s hair lightly away from his eyes, she sighed.
            &nbsp;As grateful as she was for his survival, she truly wished she remembered what had happened. &nbsp;The
            doctors blamed it on blood loss and concussion and traumatic stress, but Bibby and Kenny still fretted over
            the fact that they didn&rsquo;t know who to thank or how to thank them. &nbsp;Even the ambulance workers
            didn&rsquo;t get a name of the man they said had brought them to shore. &nbsp;Due to the storm, they
            hadn&rsquo;t even gotten a good look at him.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bibby looked up at the tv. &nbsp;The network news was replaying a spot from a local
            news station regarding a tornado just outside Dallas. &nbsp;Bibby watched, fascinated, as the woman
            reporter, her face streaked and dirty, hair disheveled and clothes a wreck, reported on the very tornado she
            had just lived through. &nbsp;It was fascinating. &nbsp;Her hand trembled slightly, but she was calm and
            composed. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bibby watched as the woman held up a piece of hand-written sheet music and spoke
            tenderly of a young musician killed in the storm, the song found in his pocket.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Now we&rsquo;re left to wonder who will sing it,&rdquo; the reporter
            said.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Bibby sat straight up, wincing as the motion caused a stab of pain through her head.
            &nbsp;Glancing at Kenny, she smiled. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I have a great idea for a thank you,&rdquo; she said to her sleeping husband.
            &nbsp;Then she turned to the phone and dialed her agent.</span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c9"></span></p>

    <p class="c6"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c15" id="h.44sinio"><span class="c13">A Thursday in May &ndash; One year later</span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c6"><span class="c7"></span></p>
    <p class="c3"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace quickly twisted her hair up behind her, clipping it to her head with a
            plastic clip. &nbsp;Starting the car, she activated the convertible top, sighing deeply as the top moved up
            and back, the early summer air and sun streaming in. &nbsp;Tipping her head back and smiling, Candace drank
            in the morning.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Pulling out of the parking spot at her apartment, Candace waved to Julio who was
            walking Brutus toward the field across the drive and stopped the car.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Julio! You up for some competition later?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The boy laughed and waved. &nbsp;&ldquo;Sure, Miss Candace! &nbsp;Are you sure
            you&rsquo;re up for it?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace pointed her finger in mock admonition. &nbsp;&ldquo;Just remember to be
            respectful to your elders, young man! &nbsp;And yes, I&rsquo;m up for it.&rdquo; &nbsp;She held her hands up
            as if holding a game controller. &nbsp;Wiggling her thumbs, she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been
            exercising!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Julio laughed and waved, the big dog practically pulling him off his feet in his
            eagerness to get to the field.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace watched them a moment, then pulled away. &nbsp;She just had a few things to
            get from the store for her trip tomorrow. &nbsp;She had heard of a special needs young man who had an
            uncanny knack for training dogs. &nbsp;He could teach even the most unruly dogs to listen and learn.
            &nbsp;Candace was hoping to tie him in with a service dog organization. &nbsp;The boy was almost seventeen
            and would be out of school soon. &nbsp;A productive future didn&rsquo;t seem very likely for him.
            &nbsp;Until now.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace smiled. &nbsp;The collar of her loose cotton dress blew up and tickled her
            chin. &nbsp;Pushing it back down, she realized she couldn&rsquo;t remember the last time she&rsquo;d worn a
            power suit. &nbsp;Not being in front of the cameras hadn&rsquo;t done her wardrobe any good, that was for
            sure. &nbsp;But writing rather than filming allowed her to develop more depth to her pieces. &nbsp;She was
            surprised how much she truly enjoyed writing and the detail it allowed her. Like that big story broadcast
            locally about the Turner family whose father had been denied his military benefits. &nbsp;Candace
            couldn&rsquo;t help but think how she would have portrayed Jeremy and his family had she been allowed to
            write the piece. &nbsp;She shook her head at her own arrogance. &nbsp;It didn&rsquo;t matter anyway &ndash;
            the story had worked out beautifully and the family was well taken care of. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace tipped her head up a little, enjoying the feel of the air on her face.
            &nbsp;Freelancing allowed her a lot of freedoms also. &nbsp;One of the biggest was being able to be home
            more, which was about to become very important.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her cell phone chimed Danny&rsquo;s tone. Clicking her earpiece, she chirped,
            &ldquo;Hi, love!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Where are you?&rdquo; he asked.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace shook her head, grinning. &nbsp;&ldquo;I am simply going to the store to get
            what I need for tomorrow. &nbsp;I won&rsquo;t be out long.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Danny sighed. &nbsp;Candace could hear the sounds of the other firemen in the
            background. &nbsp;&ldquo;Are you sure you have to go?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Fighting the urge to laugh, Candace said patiently, &ldquo;Yes, Danny, you know I do.
            &nbsp;This could be a great chance for this kid. &nbsp;And I promise this will be the last trip for awhile.
            &nbsp;Okay?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">There was a brief silence, then her husband said, &ldquo;Okay. &nbsp;Sorry to be such
            a worrywart.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Candace laid her hand on her protruding belly. &nbsp;&ldquo;That&rsquo;s okay, daddy.
            &nbsp;You&rsquo;re allowed to worry. &nbsp;I promise to take good care of the two of us, okay?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Okay&mdash;&ldquo; Candace heard the alarm go off in the station.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Gotta go! Love you!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Love you, too!&rdquo; she said quickly before the phone went dead.
            &nbsp;Praying quickly for him and whatever the reason was for the call, Candace frowned. &nbsp;Gently
            rubbing her belly again, she found herself fretting for the millionth time about her firefighter husband.
            &nbsp;Sighing, she turned on the radio, hoping to be distracted by some upbeat music. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Her whole body relaxed when she heard what was playing. &nbsp;It wasn&rsquo;t upbeat,
            but there was just something special about the song. &nbsp;It was written by that young man who had died in
            the store during the tornado. &nbsp;Bibby Coonts had picked up the rights and recorded it. &nbsp;It went
            positively viral on the charts, keeping the top spot for an unprecedented time, and even now, a year later,
            still showing strong. &nbsp;Bibby and her husband-manager, Kenny Schwartz, had reportedly donated every bit
            of the proceeds to a music camp they had established for at-risk kids. &nbsp;They had named the camp
            Elliott&rsquo;s Song. &nbsp;Candace smiled again.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Funny how things work out.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne turned up the radio. &nbsp;She loved that song. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d never heard
            of Bibby Coonts a year ago, but now she listened to her all the time. &nbsp;This &ldquo;Hand of God&rdquo;
            song was really something special.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Grams!&rdquo; The call brought her out of her music trance. &nbsp;She turned
            to see her granddaughter, Abbie, running into the room. &nbsp;Holding out her arms, she caught the
            four-year-old and swung her around, the girl squealing as her feet trailed out behind her. &nbsp;It was a
            morning ritual.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne set her down, kissing the top of her head. &nbsp;&ldquo;Help me with the
            breakfast?&rdquo; she said.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Abbie was already running toward the kitchen. &nbsp;Ariadne looked up to see
            Kristina, her daughter, coming into the dining room, looking every bit the college student with her jeans
            and polo shirt, a backpack slung over her shoulder. &nbsp;She tipped her head toward the radio.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;I like that song,&rdquo; she said.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me too,&rdquo; Ariadne nodded. &nbsp;&ldquo;Coffee?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Of course! &nbsp;Don&rsquo;t expect me to survive classes today without that
            and one of your scones, do you?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne laughed and kissed her lightly on the cheek. &nbsp;&ldquo;No, ma&rsquo;am!
            &nbsp;Come on, my helper is in the kitchen.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The women walked into the kitchen where Ariadne had obviously already been hard at
            work. &nbsp;An array of fruit bowls, baskets of scones, bowls of jams and creams, were already waiting on
            the table to be carried into the dining room. &nbsp;She would start now on her almost famous cheese and
            vegetable omelets so they would still be hot when the guests at her bed and breakfast began to rise for
            their day.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne poured a thermal cup of coffee for Kristina, adding just the right amount of
            cream. &nbsp;As she twisted the top onto the cup, she watched her talking to Abbie, the two laughing
            together. &nbsp;Ariadne&rsquo;s heart caught in her throat. &nbsp;She never thought she&rsquo;d be thankful
            for a tornado, but that experience changed everything for her. &nbsp;She&rsquo;d come out of that demolished
            store knowing that her career was over. &nbsp;She no longer wanted to be part of that world. &nbsp;It had,
            however, provided her a substantial savings, making the purchase of the b-and-b easy. &nbsp;Convincing her
            daughter to move in and allow Ariadne to care for the little one while Kristina when to school to complete
            her degree was another matter all together.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">But sincerity won in the end. &nbsp;Her daughter still had two years to go before she
            achieved her diploma and teaching degree, but there was no hurry. &nbsp;The three spent every evening
            together, Ariadne teaching them how to crochet, Abbie entertaining her mother and grandmother with stories
            she&rsquo;d made up, the adults laughing. &nbsp;So much laughing. &nbsp;Ariadne&rsquo;s eyes teared
            up.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh mama,&rdquo; her daughter said, seeing her expression.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;re such a sap.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Ariadne said, nodding in agreement as she wiped her eyes.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Then Kristina walked over, scone and coffee in hand, and kissed her cheek.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;I love your sappy little heart,&rdquo; she said lightly. &nbsp;&ldquo;You two have a nice
            day.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ariadne just grinned and nodded. &nbsp;&ldquo;You too,&rdquo; she said. &nbsp;Then
            she turned to her granddaughter who was looking up at her with eager eyes. &nbsp;Another whole day ahead of
            them, the magic of the possibilities alive in the child&rsquo;s face.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Life was such an adventure.</span></p>
    <p class="c3 c5"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal Nixon hated ties. &nbsp;He tried for the fourth time to tie it, never remembering
            what to wrap and tuck and turn. &nbsp;Hearing quiet laughter behind him, he grinned and turned.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;Are you laughing at me?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Helen, his wife, nodded. &nbsp;&ldquo;Yes, sir, I am. &nbsp;Come here.&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal walked over obediently and poked his chin in the air, allowing her to expertly
            tie the tie.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Good thing your job allows polos and pullovers,&rdquo; she said, standing on
            her tip-toes and kissing him lightly.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal immediately grabbed her around the waist and pulled her to him. &nbsp;His kiss
            was not a light one.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Eww,&rdquo; they heard from the doorway. &nbsp;&ldquo;They&rsquo;re at it
            again.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal and Helen turned, their arms around each other, and smiled at their children.
            &nbsp;Steven picked up the ends of his untied tie and walked to his mother who performed her magic for him
            as she had for his father just moments ago.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal&rsquo;s eyes misted as he looked at Melanie. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, Daddy.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey, allow me my moment,&rdquo; he chastised with a smile as he walked forward
            and kissed her on the cheek. &nbsp;&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not every day my baby graduates from high
            school.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Steven turned around, pushing the newly-knotted tie up under his chin.
            &nbsp;&ldquo;You going to get all weepy when your baby boy graduates college in another year?&rdquo;</span>
    </p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal raised an eyebrow. &nbsp;&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll believe it when I see it,&rdquo; he
            said, taking a playful swing at the boy who ducked out of the way.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Two hours later, the three sat in the football stadium bleachers, Helen crying openly
            as they watched Mellie walk onto the field, leading her class.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Salutatorian,&rdquo; Hal said, shaking his head. &nbsp;&ldquo;Still amazes
            me.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Steven laid his hand on his father&rsquo;s arm. &nbsp;&ldquo;She must get that from
            mom,&rdquo; he whispered, winking at his father. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal chuckled and put his arm around the boy. &nbsp;&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve sure been a
            big help to her,&rdquo; he said. &nbsp;&ldquo;She wouldn&rsquo;t have made it through chemistry without
            you.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; Steven said, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s like my father always says:
            &lsquo;That&rsquo;s what family is all about!&rsquo;&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal looked away before his eyes betrayed him and got him accused of being &ldquo;all
            weepy&rdquo; again.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The graduating class settled in, introductions were made, then the moment the Nixons
            were waiting for: &nbsp;the salutatorian&rsquo;s speech. &nbsp;Mellie had kept it top secret, getting help
            from teachers and practicing in her room with the radio on so they couldn&rsquo;t hear her. &nbsp;When she
            walked up to the microphone, she looked so small and vulnerable, Hal thought he would rush down and swoop
            her away. &nbsp;Helen&rsquo;s arm wrapping itself around his kept him anchored. &nbsp;Helen herself kept him
            anchored.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Melanie was speaking, addressing the school staff and student body.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Today,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;is all about jobs. &nbsp;My classmates and I
            have been asked from the time we could talk, &lsquo;What do you want to be when you grow up?&rsquo;
            &nbsp;And it&rsquo;s the proud parent whose child says, &lsquo;A doctor,&rsquo; or &lsquo;A lawyer,&rsquo;
            or &lsquo;President of the United States.&rsquo; I know many of my classmates sitting here have just such
            goals.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What mama&rsquo;s heart wants to hear her child say, &lsquo;I want to be a
            computer technician for the public school system&rsquo;?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal&rsquo;s heart thumped in his chest. &nbsp;Helen gripped his arm tighter.
            &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;And likely,&rdquo; Melanie went on, &ldquo;my father when he was a boy
            didn&rsquo;t actually say that. &nbsp;He probably said he wanted to be a doctor, or, more likely for my dad,
            a professional musician. &nbsp;He didn&rsquo;t even know what a computer was back then. &nbsp;Yet,
            &nbsp;today, that&rsquo;s exactly what he is &ndash; a computer technician for this public school system.
            &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Is this a great job? &nbsp;Not really. &nbsp;Does he love it? &nbsp;I doubt
            it. &nbsp; So why does this job elevate my Dad to hero status in my mind?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal&rsquo;s eyes widened and he heard Helen sniffing next to him.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Because my Dad has decided his first job is, well, to be perfectly frank,
        </span><span class="c4">me</span><span class="c0">. &nbsp;Or, to be more accurate, my family. &nbsp;His
            wage-earning job is sufficient for our family&rsquo;s needs, but its lack of demands on his time has made it
            possible for him to spend more time with us, his family.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;A year ago, my dad could have been killed. &nbsp;He was in a store when a
            tornado destroyed it. &nbsp;He was on television that day. &nbsp;He had a chance to talk about how scared he
            was, to brag about saving the lives of at least two men, to have his fifteen minutes of fame. &nbsp;You know
            what his great line was? &lsquo;I just want to get home to my family.&rsquo; And that&rsquo;s where
            he&rsquo;s been ever since, with his whole heart.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;So, I urge you, my fellow classmates, as we go out into the world to seek our
            fame and fortune, to consider what you want to be when you grow up. &nbsp;There are some jobs more important
            even than medicine or law or politics. &nbsp;You&rsquo;re doing one of them already &ndash; you are part of
            a family. &nbsp;That&rsquo;s where the real heroes are.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Hal hugged Helen&rsquo;s arm up against him, felt Steven&rsquo;s hand slide into his
            on the other side. &nbsp;Unashamed, he let the tears flow as he watched his daughter step away from the
            microphone and take her seat with her class. &nbsp;Hal looked up at the sky, blue and clear, just a slight
            breeze keeping the proud audience cool.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">He just loved May.</span></p>

    <p class="c3"><span class="c9"></span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ebony Franks looked around in total confusion. &nbsp;A tall man standing nearby
            looked just as baffled. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;You have any idea what&rsquo;s going on?&rdquo; she asked him. &nbsp;He looked
            shell-shocked and didn&rsquo;t answer.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ebony put her hand on her hip and frowned, turning in a slow circle. &nbsp;When she
            did, she saw a young man walking toward her, his brow furrowed, his face almost angry.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happ&rsquo;ning?&rdquo; he barked at her. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ebony lifted one eyebrow and tipped her head at him. &nbsp;&ldquo;Watch your tone,
            young man. &nbsp;I don&rsquo;t have any idea what&rsquo;s happening. &nbsp;I was just on the subway
            &ndash;&ldquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Me too!&rdquo; both men answered at once.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ebony frowned at them. &nbsp;&ldquo;I thought there was an accident,&rdquo; she
            said.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;There was!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ebony looked around her at the grass and trees. &nbsp;&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; she said,
            her voice getting quieter, &ldquo;where are we?&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The tall man just shrugged and looked like he was about to cry.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Hey!&rdquo; &nbsp;It was the young man, pointing. &nbsp;&ldquo;Maybe we can
            find some help there!&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ebony and the tall man looked in the direction he was pointing. &nbsp;Ahead of them
            they could see a house. &nbsp;A yellow, country-looking house. &nbsp;There was nothing else around them as
            far as the eye could see.</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ebony sighed and lifted her shoulders. &nbsp;&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I
            don&rsquo;t see no other choice. &nbsp;Let&rsquo;s go see if anybody&rsquo;s home.&rdquo;</span></p>
    <p class="c1"><span class="c0">The three walked through the grass and flowers toward the yellow house, hoping it
            held some answers for them.</span></p>
